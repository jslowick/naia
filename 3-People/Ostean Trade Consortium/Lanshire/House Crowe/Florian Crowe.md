Few people in [[House Crowe]] yearn for adventure more than Florian.  She has been beggining her father, [[Cedric Crowe]] to let her do something that sees more of Naia than [[Lanshire Reef]].  Finally he's relented and let her take over [[HMS Sovereign]] as [[Captain]].  She's much too young and inexperienced, but the operation basically runs itself, and not even the [[Pirate Kingdom]] tries to interfere anymore.
