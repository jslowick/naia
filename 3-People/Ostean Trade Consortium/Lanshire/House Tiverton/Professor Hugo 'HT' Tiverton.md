While technically the next in [[House Tiverton]] in line for the throne, the eldest son of [[High King Charlemain Tiverton|Charlemain]] is currently teaching at the [[Universa Arbitrum]] in [[Freehold]], though he does promise to return to [[Lanshire]] if absolutely needed.  

Known at the school as Professor HT, he tends to keep his family ties a secret.
