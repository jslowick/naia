Whereabouts unknown, possibly sunk, lost in a [[Bad Storm]] being towed across the [[2-Oshanan Trench|Trench]].

[[Princess Sonya Tiverton]] hired the Aurora to secret her away from [[Lanshire]].  When it was attacked and taken by The Bounty.  After the mutiny, and the fact the Aurora was severely damaged, she was attached by tow line to the Wayward Bounty, while the [[Sentient Figureheads]] situation was dealt with.  After that, fleeing from other OTC ships, the Aurora's tow line snapped in a [[Bad Storm]] crossing the trench, and is either missing or sunk.
