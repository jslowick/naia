The leader of [[The Hexwood]] wears a laminate, wood, and metal suit of full plate armor that completely covers himself.  He does not talk, but has a Squire, [[Speaker Kerrick]] that speaks for him.  Some claim the suit of armor is magical, or cursed, or that he needs it to survive.

He took over after the fall of [[House Thorndown]], who used to control [[The Hexwood]].
