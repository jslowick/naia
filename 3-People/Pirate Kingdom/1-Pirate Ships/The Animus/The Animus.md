The Animus used to be [[Merrick the Grey|Merrick's]] ship, before he was mutinied against and abandoned on [[Reyka'Est]] years ago.  [[Roderic Vance]] became the new captain, and many years later, as luck would have it, a [[Bad Storm]] forced the Animus to beach on North Cove, right back into Merrick's hands, which only two of the old crew survived his revenge, [[Fid]] and [[GusGus]]  

On [[Reyka'Est]], gained three more crew, [[Bear]], [[Pommol]], and [[Primrose]]
