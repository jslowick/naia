When the [[The Wayward Bounty|Bounty]] rammed the [[WSS Aurora (Missing)| WSSAurora]] rammed  during the fight that captured the Aurora, both [[Sentient Figureheads]] were severely damaged.

Auroras old figurehead:  [[Magnus the Swift]], Sail of the Four Winds
Bounty's old figurehead: [[Jacob the Black]], Scourge of the Seven Seas.

It was decided that both would not survive, so [[Locke Cordwainer]] combined the two.  It did not fully work until they were able to steal two powerful gems at [[The Crystal Isles]], one [[Onyx Gemstones|Onyx]] and one [[Rubies|Ruby]].  The new figurehead miraculously awoken, renaming himself Ja- (from, Jacob) and -nus (from Magnus) to form Ja'nus.

The new figurehead wanted a new name for the ship, and thus it was decided on The Wayward Bounty, and bypassed the bad luck of renaming ships.
