When the [[WSS Aurora (Missing)]] rammed the [[The Wayward Bounty|Bounty]] during the fight that captured the Aurora, both [[Sentient Figureheads]] were damaged.

Auroras old figurehead:  [[Magnus the Swift]], Sail of the Four Winds
Bounty's old figurehead: [[Jacob the Black]]

It was decided that both would not survive, so [[Locke Cordwainer]] combined the two.  It did not fully work until they were able to steal two powerful gems, one [[Onyx Gemstones]] and one [[Rubies]].  The new figurehead miraculously awoken, renaming himself Ja (from, Jacob) and nus (from magnus) to form Ja'nus.

The new figurehead wanted a new name for the ship, and thus it was decided on The Wayward Bounty, and bypassed the bad luck of renaming ships.
