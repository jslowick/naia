Ex-pirate lord who was removed for being too zealous, appointed to oversee the mining and control of [[Deephaven]].  Has a deal with [[The Hexwood]] to trade metal for wood.  Wildly fanatical and religious.  Both [[Pirate Kingdom|pirates]] and [[Ostean Trade Consortium|OTC]] respect his tradeship flag.
