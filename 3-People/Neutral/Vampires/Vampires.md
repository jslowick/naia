Powerful beings that hide amongst humans and feed on them to survive.  There is a myth they can't go out in sunlight, but they just dislike it as they cannot use many of their powers in it, and sunburn easily.

Vampires hide their true nature, and are able to beguile their victims into letting them feed, and some of the powerful ones are said to even be able to make people forget they were fed on.

Vampires are said to come from [[Illumia]] where they were driven out, and now spread around the world.
