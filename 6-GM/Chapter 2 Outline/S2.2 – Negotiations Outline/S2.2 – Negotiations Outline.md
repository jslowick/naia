## Scene 1: The Negotiations(30m)
Recap, fid being fishy.
Tony Vision retcon – forgot the prodigal son on aramath

Victoria brings the two windspeakers up too early
Penny looks at primrose and pales, she would like to renegotiate.  You cant leave me with that monster

Fid smalltalk about [[The Barracuda]], [[Lord Masque]] ship

Erin – wants to go below decks to search for a compass
Ryan – wants a worm
Wants: Windspeakers, Crew
Gives: Search his ship, Salts Bird, Violin, worm?

[[Hellstring Dirge]]

Won it in a game on Aramath, at the Dead Man’s Hand.Said to be won by Joel “Jolly” Roger vs the Devil himself, First Mate to Davy Jones. Was practicing with it before the shark attack.  (This part sounds a little fishy to PCs)  The old captain, Roderic Vance refused to let him play it on the ship after a while.  Theres a bit of a longing to keep it, but greed of keeping the full ransom is in play as well.

## Scene 2: Below Decks(30m)
Can move this to after being boarded if wanted/needed


Will agree to Tony going below, Neve can sneak as well.  Erin hmm

Primrose is hiding something below decks, that she got for selene  Most of the hold has been rearranged, theres a large glass box in it, swirling in Mist something in it. (Djinn) Primrose says its hers, and she didn’t go to the Sea of Mists and then deal with a shipwreck, then fight a witch for nothing.  She warns she will fight if PCs pursue this further.

[[The Animus' Box]]

If tony, he gets bamboozled by primrose, if anyone else, compel vs primrose that she feeds on them, and they forget what they see

If only neve sees

Squeak… squeak… master, master… big box, iron corners, rivets tight. Glass shines, fog inside, swirling, whispering. Claws? No Hands… yes, yes hands press walls, pale, twitchy. Rest hides… mist lost, can’t see, can’t smell. Feels wrong, feels hungry. Squeak-squeak… don’t like it, master. Want to scamper, want to hide in dark cracks, far from the box…

## Scene 3: The Red Darling (1h+)
As you end the negotiations and both begin to sail in different directions, the Red Darling shows up.  It starts pursuing the Animus.  The storm begins to pick up, and the water is choppy and bad.


BATTLE MAP

Naval Battle - explain naval rules again
[[Naval Combat Quick]]

Lookout triangles
Left:  The Choppy water there is surface only, and the currents arent nearly as bad there as it looks.
Middle:  The calmness in the center is the ocean pulling back for a big wave or waves, beware.
Right: The current pull here is stronger than it looks but if you can crest the wave quickly, you could gain momentum on the downside.





If Boarded SECOND BATTLEMAP
[[The Red Darling]] for crew list

If NPCs losing, try to sink animus then flee, giving choice.
