Floating piece of debris, ghost on it, he looks forlornly down and there are ruins down there.  You would need to spend an [[Aether]] to try to take a look.

## Scene 2 - The Robbery

Robbery at Ashander's folly, they almost got ophelia's stuff

SUPER concerning, the culprits were WIndspeakers, and they did not have a compass.  Not sure how thats even possible.

Kraye caught them, but they had already offloaded it somewhere around here.  Per order of [[Hollyn Kraye]], I have a writ from the Council of Twelve to search this vessel.
