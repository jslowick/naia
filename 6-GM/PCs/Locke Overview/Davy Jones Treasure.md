Treasure Map

Three Treasures, I have fleeced
If thou seek that I fear not the least
Thou must travel to the belly of the beast
To guard thy ship from the trenches darkness
Coat it in the whirlpool of the Abyss
Only in the light of the Blue moon’s kiss
To summon ancient protection, it requires
Three caves, three runes, three spires, 
With blood of witch, mist, and vampires
First Spit into Gods Eye
Then take Purgatory Steps nigh
Lastly Devils Tongue thou must tie
-Davy Jones
