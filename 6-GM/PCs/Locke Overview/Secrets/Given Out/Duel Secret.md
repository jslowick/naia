You were a crew on the HMS Consequence, and while in enemy waters, the ship took drastic damage.  Your captain, Admiral Marbury was friends with the Shipwright, Master Archeron, who was in charge of Port Abalash.  Your ship was drydocked for weeks getting repairs there.  The Bos’un of the Consequence was a rich Lanshire noble, Lander Windam, and in your opinion was completely useless.  Eventually he made a big enough mistake that almost got you and some crew killed in a construction accident.  You challenged him to a duel.  This was under the Purview of Master Archeron, who allowed it, despite your Lord Marbury’s misgivings.  You were losing the duel, in desperation, you shot him, aiming to wound, but killed him outright.  The Windams were powerful nobles in Lanshire, and you drew their wrath, the wrath of your captain, and that of Master Archeron.  You fled on a slaver going south that night, but that ship was then captured by the Bounty, you agreed to join up as a pirate knowing your fate in OTC was no more.  You are ashamed of this, and are probably not welcome at Port Abalash anymore, one of the few Ship Builders in Naia.
