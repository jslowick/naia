You know of the Valiant and have personally met Briggs before, but it was years ago before both of you turned Pirate.   Briggs highly disagreed with slavery, and mutinied against Percival Windam.  He was blamed for his death, making the two of you almost kindred spirits.  He is known to have a high sense of honor, and do the right thing, and is a pirate because of circumstance, not choice.  It feels off that he would be helping Pirates attack each other without a GOOD reason.
