One of your fellow seamen on the HMS Consequence was Nicholas Beaumont.  He was training to go undercover as a pirate and was one of the men you saved in the construction accident that caused the duel you were disgraced because of.  After the accident he got the nickname Nicky “Nine-lives” and here he is again, in the flesh, clearly undercover and pretending to be a pirate aboard the Albatross.
