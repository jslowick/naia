You always enjoyed Wilton Newcomb’s visits, he would come to the Nightmarket roughly twice a year, and always bring you a present of something, you figured out quite early he was more than just an Importer, and was a fence.  He stopped coming to the Nightmarket about about a year ago, when he had a “boating accident”.  After the accident he began to write you about once a month, and you became pen pals, and closer than ever.  In person Wilton Newcomb’s “boating accident” looks more like torture to you.  With fingers broken and missing an arm, theres no way those letters were written by Wilton, watching his handwriting.  You’re sure those letters must have come from his apprentice.
