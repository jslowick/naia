Four powerful guys, some former pirates, some OTC, some intermediates, retire from the sea to a rich section of Freeport, ending as neighbors with mansions one on each side of an exclusive town square. They proceed to make absolute menaces of themselves with their rivalry over Every Last Thing. They compete and fight over who is/has the best of everything, pulling locals into their strife and annoying them greatly.

If one had a grand carriage made, the other had to commission grander. If one has a precious hardwood tree on their estate, another would litigate the land boundaries or argue their three smaller ones were of higher value. They dueled, they competed (and cheated) at horseracing (are there horses?) and cards, they paraded and poached each others' lovers, they stole each others' dogs.

Perhaps the witch acted from wise intent. Perhaps our of amusement, to egg them on. Possibly, the witch was just fed up with it all (it can be hard to tell with witches). Whatever the aim, when the baby was found bundled and left alone in the square between all four houses, it was with only this note: "She's yours."

Of course they fought. But as they raised voices the baby began to wail, and as they struggled over her she slipped out of her blanket and to the cobbled ground, gashing her scalp on a rough stone there.

The four men gasped. One scooped her up immediately, to hold for another who examined the wound, aided by the silk handkerchief proffered by a third, as the fourth caught the child's attention with a silly song to distract her.

It wouldn't be the last time they fought over her--or with!--sorting out matters from her name to where she would spend those weeks of the year not easily divisible by four, but Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisin grew up the beloved daughter of four fathers, and learned many things from each.

So that's my schtick

Backstory

When the four pirate captains retired to Ashander’s Folly, they brought their rivalry ashore with them. Their four mansions faced each other across the fountain square, each grander than the last, always aspiring to outshine the others. If one had a splendid palanquin made, the other had to commission one even more luxurious. If a precious hardwood tree grew on one estate, another would litigate the land boundaries or argue their three smaller saplings were of higher value. They dueled, they competed (and cheated) at crab-racing and cards, they paraded and poached each others' lovers, they stole each others' dogs. To the neighbors, even by the standards of the Folly, this constant feuding was an absolute menace.

Perhaps the witch acted from wise intent. Perhaps out of amusement, to egg them on. Possibly, the witch was just fed up with it all (it can be hard to tell with witches). Whatever the aim, when the baby was found bundled and abandoned in the square between all four houses, of course the four captains fought. But as they raised their voices the baby began to wail, and as they struggled over her she slipped out of her blanket and to the cobbled ground, gashing her scalp on a rough stone. The captains gasped. One scooped her up immediately, to hold for the second to examine the wound, aided by the silk handkerchief proffered by the third, as the fourth caught the child's attention with a song to distract her. It wouldn't be the last time they fought over her--or with!--over her name, where she would spend those weeks of the year not easily divisible by four, and how she _would_ set out to make her fortune without their interference, but Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisín grew up the beloved daughter of four fathers, and learned many things from each.
