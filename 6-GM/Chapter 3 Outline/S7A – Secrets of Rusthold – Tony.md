The stairs go all the way to the top, then theres a center staircase that goes all the way to the basement

exhausting, but time is up the essence

### Scene 2: The Ambush

Vampire Hunter ambushes Johan to stop him from opening the coffin

Approach the door in the dim light, you inspect it for a bit, and catch the glint of something

You luckily get your hand up to your throat, as the garrote loops around it and cinches tight, cutting off most of your breath and cutting into your hand and parts of your neck.

The garrote smells strongly of garlic and it actually stings a little more than you would have though, but you have more pressing problems

You gain the complication – Being Garroted

Back into sharp rocks/bars

Back into Fire

Back off the ledge
