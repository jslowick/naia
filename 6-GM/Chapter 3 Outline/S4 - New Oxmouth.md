## Scene 1: Lay of the Land

Been renamed recently to "New" Oxmouth, aka under new management.  

Docks clogged with many ships, no room, need to anchor and dingy in.  It looks like [[Lord Masque]] got the last spot, and his ship takes up two spaces.  The other ship he was towing in, [[The Marlin]] is anchored off in the bay, it looks badly damaged.

There's a fairly nice bay, but it leaves the ship alone, and vulnerable.  Choice what to do.  Salt gets a bad feeling about this place.

Ships

[[The Long Shadow]]
[[The Barracuda]], Lord Masque Ship
[[The Marlin]]
The Bad Hangover - Captain Rattlebones (Missing)
The Rumrunner - Captain Mohat Mala (Missing)
The Ill Omen - Captain Nara Shafe
The Manticore - Captain “Bloody” Mary

Right off the Docks is a square, the old Commodore that Wilton told you to see, that was sympathetic, is dead in a gibbet, looks like [[Merrick the Grey]]'s work.


Greycoat guards are arresting [[Barrel]], one of [[Lord Masque]]'s guys.  [[Sable]] is there trying to warn/negotiate, but so far they are just talking.  They don't harass PCs unless they do something.


[[Hoof & Chain]]
Bartender Evelyn “V” Holdt – worried about losing her bar, doesn’t want outsiders around, but also needs their money.

“Shakes” Murphy, pirate with Pitch Tremors (get from applying the tar to help the ships cross the trench)  Willing to talk about changes, and how he thinks the witch is behind it.

## Scene 2: The Robbery

Small Contingent from Lock, OTC in the streets, carrying an obvious lockbox of treasure.

For masque? Witch?  They have a writ signed by the Magistrate and new Commodore.

They are working for Lord Corwin Varchek the Second, and believe the name alone will protect them.  Quick payday for an enemy, or let sleeping dragons lie?

Natasha’s familiar leads them to her Meet Natasha, Rakes twin

## Scene 3: Natasha

Shes surrounded by greycoats – Fight

[BATTLE MAP]

Too many witches.  Got one of them, but don’t have a way to deal with the White witch.  Got Persephone, with a Cinderwoven Effigy, made by Hobbes Knot-Eye, one of Master Archeron’s principal woodcarvers.  Don’t have another one though, the Witch has many of the influential pirate captains, those that have returned have been on Lysandra’s side.

Sent those looking for Rake on a wild rat-chase to Tarsus, so stay away from there.

Someone has been helping her, thought it was you guys (actually persephone’s group)

Shes trying to rescue the pirate captains being held by Lysandra

Shes found out that they are being held in Rusthold, the old pre-pirate once slaver fort, that is avoided, because its cursed.  Frontal assault will be impossible, but theres an hidden underground entrance in the Boneways, old tunnels under Oxmouth, entrance she knows about is in the Deadmans hand, a gambling den.

Need to be invited into the backrooms.

## Scene 5: The Back Rooms

In back room, Theres a Table with a captain playing alone (Tony sees rest of the seats are ghosts.

Another room, has multiple captains gambling with their crew and ships pieces.

Theres a fortune teller doing paintings (related to previous teller?).  In his room is a mural of something, that’s the entrance to the Boneways?

Seris “Snake Eyes” Eyrell, Prodigal Son of Maris.  His mother disappeared 13 years ago, he blames Firebeard.  Ankle chained to desk.

Need to convince him to let them into the boneways, he has to paint the entrance open.

If time:  RP with [[Edgar 'Ledger' Hawke]], gives Tony a quest



When they enter the boneways, wander around a little lost, one of the exits is into 

[[The Broken Scalpel]]
[[Dr. Gideon 'Goldfingers' Hallow]]“ would work on Winters (or natasha) for a lot of gold.

The tunnel splits ahead into two dripping arches, the air thick with the stink of brine and rot.

To the **left**, the stone floor pulses with a fine **spray of saltwater**, as though the sea itself is breathing through the cracks. The walls are scarred with long gouges, and in the dark, you swear you hear the faint **clicking of many legs on stone**, which you only hope could be rats.

To the **right**, the air grows heavier, humid and sour, carrying the **reek of spoiled rum and rotten fruit**. A sluggish trail of sticky green residue follows along the floor, glistening faintly, as though it remembers the taverns it once dripped through. The air here is thick—too thick—like the tunnel is solidifying it.

You get a bad feeling about both of them...
