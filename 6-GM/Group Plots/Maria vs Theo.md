Theodoro
Shares Suspicion of Maria Theodoro, reinforcing the red herrings. he’s just throwing her under the bus.

He volunteers first for dangerous tasks, maybe even saving a PC in combat — making it hard to imagine he’d betray them.

He "uncovers" sabotage or hidden symbols (that he planted himself), which helps him gain trust as the vigilant crewmate.

Maria leaves the Serpents maw after an argument with Pike, looking for her mother.
Theodoro helps PCs find Wilton, expresses worry that Maria is hiding things.


Recruits Theodoro and Maria to deliver the Dockmaster, Detrik Crowe (known Lysandra sympathizer) who ends up dead.  Maria skips out on delivery to deal with the loan shark.


Returning to the Docks/Ship, Dietrich is murdered, and PCs are questioned as he had just sent them a note about their ship being a nuisance because of the storms.  They tell the PCs not to leave port and their ship will be impounded until its cleared up.

PCs realize it was either Theodoro or Maria or both that did it.
