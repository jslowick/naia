IRL Date: September 6, 2025 Part of [[Chapter 2 - Aramath]]<br/>
Previous Session: [[S4 - The Rescue]] Next Session: [[S2 - The Way to Aramath]]

[[Locke Cordwainer]] destroyed the two [[Rusty Flintlock]] and upgrades the firing and reloading mechanisms in [[Locke's Wheellock Gun]].

[[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] spends a Mana and uses [[Alchemy]] on the [[Waterlogged Pages]].

He sacrifices the Letter of Marque and related pages and focuses on [[God's Eye]].  The papers clearly have notes from [[Lord Masque]] on them, and some newer writing that is of an unknown author.  He also finds there are three specific places in three specific cave systems on three islands of [[Aramath]].
- [[God's Eye]] in [[Labyrinth Caverns]] on [[2-People/Neutral/Amarath/The Ox/The Ox]]
- [[Devil's Tongue]] in [[Many-Faced Caves]] on [[2-People/Neutral/Amarath/The Coin/The Coin]]
- [[Purgatory Steps]] in [[Vault Mines]] on [[The Lock]]
Somehow all of this related to three pieces of [[Davy Jones]]' treasure
- [[The Godkiller]]
- [[Tricorn of the Changeling]]
- [[The Damascus Blade]]

The crew buries the [[Cargo]] of [[Onyx Gemstones]] on [[Reyka'Maye]] but accepts a group Offer that maybe they didn't hide it as well as they'd hoped.

Sailing on the Bayside of [[Reyka'Est]] is no less dangerous, for other reasons.  The crew notices [[Merrick the Grey]] is building [[The Grey Docks]] and [[The Domino]] is moored there.  It has a skeleton crew, so while it does attempt to chase them, it is far behind.

They notice many of the other features of the island they didn't get a chance to explore, including [[Turtle Beach]], [[Shipwreck - The Wedged Razor]], [[Shipwreck Cove]], [[Mistpoint]] and [[Widow's Watch]].

Right as [[Johan Kristoff]] is having a [[Prophecy]] about a recently sunk [[6-Dreadnaught]] in [[Sharkfin Bay]] and something very large and powerful messing with it below the surface, [[Rake, The Rat Prince]] notices [[Merfolk]] including [[Sirens]].  Something happens and Rake is barely able to shrug off something powerful, even though he couldn't hear the Sirens, this allows the [[The Wayward Bounty]] to not be completely ambushed by the school of [[Hammerheads]].

The [[Hammerheads]] seem unnaturally fast and tough, even for [[Jawfish]] and they distract them with chum, electric eels, and the rest of [[Johan Kristoff|Johan's]] drug supply and some great sailing by their [[Helmsmyn]], [[Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisin]] they are able to get away.

Leaving [[Sharkfin Bay]] they enter [[The Calm Bay]], and see the strange [[Stillwater Cove]] that [[Jean-Pierre]] had scouted earlier.  The Domino is gaining on them, but there is a sandbar at the northside of [[The Calm Bay]] that will prevent pursuit further and the Shallow Draft of [[The Wayward Bounty]] allows it to cross during the higher tide.  

[[The Animus]] has already left by the time they get to [[North Cove]].  [[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] uses his Flash of Insight boon from [[The Catacombs]] to chart a course to intercept.

Once the danger of [[Reyka]] is behind everyone, [[Jasper 'The Kid' Ravenhart]] confesses about the secret hes been hiding.  He's not actually a deckhand, but a Ward of [[Princess Sonya Tiverton]], a stowaway.  He leads the crew to the [[First Mate]] cabin, where the injured [[Tristan Winters]] is, and well-hidden room concealing well-dressed [[2-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Lanshire/Lanshire]] noblewoman.  She looks EXACTLY like the [[Portrait of Sonya]], down to what clothing she is wearing.

She explains that she was on the [[WSS Aurora (Missing)]] when it was taken, and she made a deal with [[Victor 'The Mad' Maddington (Missing)|Mr. Maddington]] and [[Tristan Winters|Mr. Winters]] to take her to the [[Free Bank of Caprona]] to access her families' vault, in exchange for a ship.  [[Locke Cordwainer]] per [[Pirate Code]] abides by deals made on the ship by previous captains.  She also mentions a red bearded pirate ([[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)|Firebead]]) put some papers in the vault as well, possibly revealing why [[Victor 'The Mad' Maddington (Missing)|Victor]] tried to sink the Aurora.

She has a purbread persian cat, named [[Buttercup]] that draws [[Rake, The Rat Prince|Rake's]] ire for killing his rats and his new peacock, which [[Johan Kristoff]] points is now a ghost, and haunting Rake.

Johan gets a bad feeling about the painting, but tries [[Prophecy]] on it anyways.  The painting is way too powerful for him, he is psychically pulled off the ship, towards [[The Beast]], but he does notice that [[Maris Eyerell 'The Sea's Eye'|Maris]] has a son, who's painting something on Aramath, but that his ankle is chained to the desk he's working at.  Before [[Johan Kristoff]] is lost to to the Abyss of a [[Deep Ones]], a delicate hand of [[Selene]] pulls him back and tells him she's got big plans for him, then slaps him awake.

After discussions with Sonya, Rake notices [[The Animus]] on the horizon, and tries to signal them with a flag, but they are not responding to hails.  This ends up delaying the rendezvous until after sunset.  They say they didnâ€™t see [[The Wayward Bounty]], but it sounds a little fishy. 
They have two creepy [[Mistborne]] crew, [[Bear]] and [[Pommol]], A Captain ([[Fid]]) recovering from bad wounds, [[2-People/Pirate Kingdom/Pirate Ships/The Animus/Primrose]] sporting a new phantom of the opera-like mask, and a crucified [[Greycoats]] [[Wormeye]] as a figurehead, who was the [[Soothsayer]] Primrose handled for [[Johan Kristoff|Johan]].

[[Johan Kristoff|Johan]] points out to [[Rake, The Rat Prince|Rake]] that he is being [[Haunted]] by the ghost of the White Peacock, and Redpan notices worms falling from [[Wormeye]].  [[Fid]] is being cagey and a little secretive, and his story about the [[Jawfish]] attack seems a little off too, and he doesn't seem to want the players to board his [[The Animus]].

The negotiations begin, but quickly breakdown, as the crew of [[The Wayward Bounty]] aren't sure exactly what they want in exchange for the Hostages, which [[2-People/Pirate Kingdom/Pirate Ships/The Animus/Primrose]] seems to want greatly.  [[Fid]] offers up his Violin, the [[Hellstring Dirge]], a powerful artifact in a seaweed encrusted case.  He claims he won it in [[Aramath]], at the [[Dead Man's Hand]], and that the original owner was [[Joel 'Jolly' Roger]] who won it from the Devil himself.

The crew huddles again, deciding that they are interested in [[Salt|Salt's]] [[Familiars|Parrot]], Looking below decks, and the Violin.  [[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask|Redpan]] is interested in [[Wormeye]] or at least the worms, causing disgust from the other crew.  They go for negotiations one more time...
