Version 1.1

Removed raise/weigh anchor from crew actions, moved it to other

Added “Broadsides” which increases range and angle of next cannon fire in a round

Moved repair ship down where raise/lower anchor was

Ship Speed in combat is now higher of pursuit/flee instead of lower

Added in percentage crew takes based on size of ship, to avoid difficult math

At character creation, and at the end of each chapter, you gain a Mastery (+1 inherent to rolls) on one of the following.  You may only choose each option once.

·       Gun Defense
·       Melee Defense
·       Create Advantage & Create Complication
·       Overcome Problem
·       Full Speed Ahead! & Add to the Sails & Come About
·       Fire the Cannons! & Load Shot & Broadsides
·       Grapple & Boarding Party & Cut Off
·       Inspire Crew & Repel Boarders & Flee
·       Ram & Recover Overboard & Ship Repairs

This means each PC gains 2 choices from the above so far.

Swashbuckler changed to have +1 Inherent to Melee Attack rolls instead of a Stance

Character sheets changed to add

Gun Attack, Gun Defense, Create Advantage, Create Complication, Overcome and crew actions as numbers.  Unless the GM specifies a specific attribute you may use these numbers.  If you do require a specific attribute roll, you may add any inherent and bonus as well.

You may now attempt to Overcome a Complication on yourself, but at a -2 penalty, overcoming a complication on an ally is unchanged.

Grazing Blow is now 1/session A Melee Attack doesn’t automatically take you out, but instead reduces you to 1 Physical Stress

Inner Fortitude is now You can attempt to remove Complications on yourself without the -2 penalty

Mental Palace is now Problem Solver and is now Gain +1 Bonus to Rolls on Overcomes

First Aid gives +2 to stabilize Overcomes but no longer helps on Complications.
