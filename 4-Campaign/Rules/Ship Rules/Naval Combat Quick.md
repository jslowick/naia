4. Check any complications, zones, or current you are in, this could happen now or at the end.
5. Each PC takes 1 crew action
   - Unless helmsmyn or cannoneer, no repeat actions in a round.  
   - There is a base roll, using your crew action, Goal 3.  
   - Then if successful, sometimes there's a second ship based roll (for cannons, speed, etc).  This uses ship stats, but PCs may add fate points, boosts, etc.  
   - If you have an idea for a crew action not in the rules, ask, could work. 
   - NPC Crew generally dont have actions, but are helping PCs do theirs.
   - If using Fire the Cannons! check the [[Cannon Diagram]] for range.
1. If Damage is successful, Check for consequences, stress, and sinking status.
