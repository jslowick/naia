Note:  This session was in person

As the crew of [[The Wayward Bounty]] is trying to get the ship back in the water, the [[Greycoats]] pirate hunters attack.  They've brought ropes to try to prevent the ship from ever leaving.  If their reinforcements get here in time, its over.

During the fight, [[Johan Kristoff]] sneaks off to deal with the ropes, and takes out a pirate, stumbling upon some waterlogged treasure.  The rest of the crew splits their efforts between dealing with the enemies, and trying to move the ship.

Eventually they get the ship partially in the water, when the large [[Aldani]] attacks, looking for revenge from getting its children eaten from [[S1 -Any Port in a Storm]].  Rake spends a mana and crashes the ship into the Aldani, knocking its Crusher Claw off, and forcing it to retreat, as they are underway.

[[Johan Kristoff]] gets a vision that if the sun rises again before the rescue, [[Isaac 'The Immortal'|Isaac]] will be dead.  They have to make good time and push themselves to get there in time.

Along the trip, they rescue a [[Ren'Yu]], [[Soka Dravanska]], who was tangled in the wreckage of his canoe, and notice [[Ostean Trade Consortium|OTC]] members of [[WSS Nautilus]] at the top of the cliffs, manacling the remaining Ren'Yu.

[[Jasper 'The Kid' Ravenhart]] is thrown overboard by a large Tsunami from the [[Starfall]] and they spend some time rescuing him, and also find two [[Windspeakers]] refugees, [[Zephyrix Penelope 'Penny' of the North Wind]] and [[Jacques Courtemer]].  After a short standoff, they capture them for ransom later.

[[Locke Cordwainer]] finds some [[Flotsam and Jetsam]] and 2x [[Aether]] in the [[Howling Riptide]], last remaining of whatever ship recently was pulled under.

[[Johan Kristoff]] predicts the last challenge being a Lightning Squall from the [[Thundering Cliffs]], and the crew is able to prepare for it.

They arrive at the [[Grimfrost Knoll]] just in time, and are able to rescue [[Isaac 'The Immortal']], [[Bear]], and [[2-People/Pirate Kingdom/Pirate Ships/The Animus/Primrose]] from gibbets there.  It is unnaturally cold, and there is death and dark energy, so the crew decides not to shed any more blood there.

[[Johan Kristoff]] convinces [[2-People/Pirate Kingdom/Pirate Ships/The Animus/Primrose]] to "deal" with the soothsayer [[Merrick the Grey]] is using to track them down.  She agrees to square the debt of rescue.  [[Bear]] lets them know that [[Merrick the Grey]] is here with his new ship, [[The Domino]], and is having a meeting of the officers and [[Lysandra, The White Witch]].

[[Isaac 'The Immortal']] lets the crew know theres a map in one of the tents that will lead to [[The Catacombs]] where they are storing treasure, with no guards with [[Wormeye]] dealt with and the rest of them at the meeting.  After some hemming and hawing they decide to try to rob the [[Greycoats]] before fleeing [[Reyka'Est]].

They enter [[The Catacombs]] and find some of [[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)|Firebeard's]] treasure as well as [[Merrick the Grey|Merrick's]].  [[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] spends the longest, finds [[Portrait of Sonya]] and [[White Peacock Feather Cloak]], as well [[Cursed|Cursing]] their ship, and findind a cursed [[The Monkey's Paw]], and in fleeing from the collapse, loses an Eye (Grievous Wound) to a falling Stalactite.

The crew decides not to help the [[Ren'Yu]] further, leaving him at his destroyed and looted village on [[Ereth'Rey]].  Their plan is the bury the [[Cargo]] of [[Onyx Gemstones]] because they do not have room for it and the new treasure, then head for [[The Animus]], to try to negotiate them helping do the hostage negotiations at [[Tiderip]] while they themselves are going to [[Aramath]], to deal with [[Lysandra, The White Witch]].
