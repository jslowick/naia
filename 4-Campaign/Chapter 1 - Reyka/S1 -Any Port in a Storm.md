The ship barely makes it ashore and needs serious work, compounded by lack of supplies or a friendly port.    Examining the surroundings of [[Moontide Cove]], the crew of [[The Wayward Bounty]] notice a large [[Makara]], on the beach.  It is big enough to be a huge problem, but does not seem aggressive so they leave it alone.  

The Players decide to heard south, to look for provisions while the rest of the crew begin the repairs.  They find the [[Coral Cove]], and the [[Shipwreck - The Enigma's End]].  Sea creatures appear to be dragging pieces of it into deeper waters, there are menacing [[Corites]] hiding in the coral, and [[Jawfish]] everywhere.

The crew debates going further in the water for more supplies and the logbook of [[The Enigma (Sunk)]] but decide the danger isn't worth it.  [[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] gathers many small [[Aldani]] to use as food.  [[Johan Kristoff]] has a vision of the wreck., caused not by the coral as suspected but of something from below that cracked the ship in half.  The surviving crew seem to have had a battle with something that looked like ghosts, but were later revealed to be [[Greycoats]] in costumes.  There were tracks on the beach as well of survivors, later revealed to be [[Pommol]], carrying something VERY heavy.

Fighting the [[Sandskimmers]] and a [[Great Whites|Great White]], they encounter a rare [[Cecaelia]], and struggle with it for a piece of the Enigma, garnering some treasure and ship repair supplies.  Afterwards, they send the 3 sellswords in 3 directions, [[Isaac 'The Immortal'|Isaac]] deep to the south towards the [[The Ruined Lighthouse|Lighthouse]] they saw, [[Veronica 'Bellringer'|Veronica]] to help ship supplies and [[Jean-Pierre]] to the west.

[[Jean-Pierre]] returns talking about [[The Calm Bay]] and [[Stillwater Cove]].  There was [[Merfolk|Mer-sign]] on that side of [[Reyka'Est]] as well.  To the north/northwest, there is another island, [[Reyka'Norr]], that he reported seeing a Tall Masted ship, the crew were able to identify as [[The Barracuda]].

[[Isaac 'The Immortal']] did not return from the Lighthouse, so the crew decides to go there next to investigate.

Treasure:
- Ship Upgrade (Flee Speed)
- 70 [[Pieces of Eight]] found in [[Coral Cove]].
