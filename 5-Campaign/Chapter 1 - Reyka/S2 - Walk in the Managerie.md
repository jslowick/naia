Walking south along [[Reyka'Est]] leads the crew of [[The Wayward Bounty]] into [[The Menagerie Jungle]], a thick and lucious jungle full of strange, and non-native flora and fauna.  [[Rake, The Rat Prince]] finds a Black Sand Iguana and a Lantern Spider, both native to the [[4-Sea of Night]].

They come across a camp of corpses, that are desiccated husks, with 3 sets of tracks fleeing from the campsite.  

The lands tremors with earthquakes, and they find a creepy hole, that people get a really bad feeling about going near.  Johan takes a look inside, finding strange multitailed foxes.  One of the earthquakes traps him in the northern section of [[The Catacombs]].  He is able to escape through an exit on the [[Haunted Cliffs]] side, with a [[Silver Cat Statue]], but there was much more treasure left behind.

On the side of the cliffs, the [[Ren'Yu]] are there tending to the bird nests, and there are many different kinds of non-native birds as well.  Afterwards, they camp for the night, and see a Snow Owl [[Familiars|Familiar]] of [[Lysandra, The White Witch]], which gives [[Rake, The Rat Prince]] a bad feeling, and nightmares.

In the day, when the tremors have calmed some, and its safer, they make there way to the [[The Ruined Lighthouse]]. 

Treasure:
[[Silver Cat Statue]] with one Emerald Eye, worth 30 [[Pieces of Eight]].
