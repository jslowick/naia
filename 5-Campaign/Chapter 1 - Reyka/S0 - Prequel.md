# Teaser
It’s been one moon and one day since the Dreadnought “Azar” has been seen or heard from, along with its crew and captain, the Pirate King, Winslow Firebeard.  Per his own code, he is considered lost at sea and the Council of 12 need to convene and replace him.  The Uneasy balance of Naia has begun to crumble, if Firebeard is no longer there will the pirate’s code fall apart as well?  Some hope for Lady Friday to finally take power, Firebeard’s harshest critic on the council,  Other’s say the Witch Sisters will replace him, but even the Soothsayers are unsure what happens next. Many worry that its a Lanshire or Windspeaker plot to attempt to rid the Seven Seas of the pirate menace once and for all, to do what Ashander never could.  But all know the seas are more dangerous now, and most common sailors on any side have no wish for a bloody, drawn out war.

# Introduction

One week before the mutiny, The Bounty and the Midnight Rose met up, Captain Victor had a VERY fancy private dinner with Fellow Pirate Lord Captain Von Drakk.  Afterwards, Victor IMMEDIATELY set out for the Aurora, scuttlebutt is the Midnight Rose was seen leaving fast in the same direction as well.  Very strange for this to happen east of the trench.

The Bounty found and chased the Aurora first.  Pursued it from near Beaconrock for weeks all the way to almost getting into Windspeaker waters.  The Black was raised, and once boarded, the Aurora surrendered.   Being in the East, this meant all crew were to be left alive with the ship per code.

In the battle with the Aurora, the two ships ended up crashing into each other head one, getting entangled.  Both Figureheads were severely damaged.  Feared that both could not survive, and since they were both sentient, was a huge blow (severe consequence).

Victor was very careful not to shoot at the Aurora with the cannons, after boarding the harder way, only he and the First Mate and Navigator Mr. Winters went below decks when the Aurora surrendered.  They were below decks for about 20 minutes.  They returned, and Victor ordered the flag changed to red, and to sink the Aurora with all hands aboard. 

The Boatswain belays the command and there was an argument.  The Cannoneer sides with Victor and starts to shoot the Aurora.  The Cannoneer is killed by the cook, who gives him tainted shot to load the cannons with.  The Lookout goes to stab the Boatswain in the back while hes still arguing with Victor, but the soothsayer warns the Boatswain, who shoots and kills the lookout.

The mutiny was going poorly at first, but Rake, his rats, a deckhand, plus a couple of sellswords from the Aurora join the Boatswains side and, things look better.  The old helmsmyn dies in mysterious circumstances in the melee, overboard pushed by the new Helmsmyn. It finally tips to the other side when Tristan Winters, switches sides, and puts a gun to Captain Victor.  Victor gives up, but after he does, shanks Winters (again against the code) who survives.

The new captain puts Victor upon Well of Lost Hope, an uninhabited island, where he is sure to be found by OTC ships, and leaves him marooned, per the code and the soothsayer’s suggestion. The new captain/boatswain is to return Victor’s signet ring and Ship’s Codex to Ashanders Folly and officially register the mutiny within 1 moon, as per the code. 

The Aurora lost two masts, most of it’s figurehead and was taking water.  It had to be towed by the Wayward Bounty rather than let it go, per code.  It’s former captain, asks for this rather than be left at the Well or the open water.  Some of the pirates on the winning side of the mutiny are left to watch the other crew.  (Ally pirate name here)

After the mutiny, during what repairs the Bounty could muster, through alchemy, rats and a very skilled Boatswain Captain, a single figurehead was saved from the remains of the two destroyed ones.  It would not awaken at first though, until the soothsayer had a vision, which entailed going to the Crystal Isles and stealing two large gems, An Onyx and a Ruby, to use as eyes. (Tony ally here?) During that raid, the ships doctor, XXX, was killed when he didn’t listen to Rake about (XXX). Winters wound gets infected after the raid.  The new figurehead names itself Janus, and renames the ship “The Wayward Bounty.” This is ok with superstition/code, because the figurehead did it, avoiding the bad luck of renaming a ship.

The Wayward Bounty has to use all its meager supply of Aether than the Boatswain had been hoarding to escape the sea of glass, and when back in the sea of strife, OTC ships find her and pursue.  The Auroras tow line is snapped crossing the trench and fleeing, the Wayward Bounty is blown precariously close to the Beast, but the new Helmsmyn manages to skirt the Beast enough to use the currents to escape pursuers as well.

The ship is in tatters, very little crew and supplies left, ends up on XXX island.  Where the game will start.
