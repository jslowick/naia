The Smoke monster attacks until Locke, Rake and Redpan align the tower gears. Gianna endangers/rescues Old Salt, the lighthouse keeper assigned by Firebeard though hasn’t seen him for months. Old Salt has lost his parrot. We acquire a white (ghost) peacock.

  

Lighthouse(s): Firebeard used island during war, made discovery, built lighthouse and brought two witches to seal it (Anastasia-cat? and Lysandra-owl? known to Rake). More (3+) lighthouses may exist including one Rake spots on Reyka’Nor to NW. A month ago Iron Titan (OTC Flagship) shelled the lighthouse followed by ship conflict offshore to W. Yesterday ghosts messed with the tower and started island rumbling.

  

Missing island: Used to be to the south around middle island, but SW island missing since accident (collapse killing many Firebeard crew, creating ghosts/not-ghosts). 

  

Johan has a super intense vision of the present: one of Lady Friday’s ships, Red Darling, notes our ship and pulls toward it with hostile vibes, but backs off into mists upon seeing Barracuda, tallest pirate ship, moored on far side of adjacent island (Reyka’Nor).

  

En route back to the ship, we see the scary owl again, a not-ghost, and tracks of a larger group chasing three people toward the W calm bay. At the ship, someone has messed with the injured first mate to hinder or help, but none of the crew confess. Repairs are complete; we decide to risk the tide and head out to attempt to rescue our lost sellsword from the southern accident-site ghosts, despite the lurking Angry Lobster that ate the beachmonster makara. We acquire makara eggs.

  

Loot: ghost peacock, makara eggs, meticulous lighthouse-gear plans
