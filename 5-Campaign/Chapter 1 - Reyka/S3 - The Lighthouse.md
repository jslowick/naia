IRL Date: July 12, 2025 Part of [[Chapter 1 - Reyka]]<br/>
Previous Session: [[S2 - Walk in the Menagerie]] Next Session: [[S4 - The Rescue]]

The rubble around the [[The Ruined Lighthouse]] are much, much older than the lighthouse itself, and the crew finds remains of statues with 4 fingers and toes.

The tower was damaged due to cannonfire, and was causing the tremors and earthquakes on [[Reyka'Est]],  Additionally some sort of [[Smoke Monster]] was coming out of the ground and attacking.

[[Rake, The Rat Prince]] noticed something hiding in the bushes, that ends up being White Peacocks, which triggers a memory in [[Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisin]].  [[Neve]] is started by the birds and runs into the tower, precipitating Rake chasing him.

The [[Silver Cat Statue]] had a single Emerald eye, which [[Rake, The Rat Prince]] used to get the Tower inside the Lighthouse open, as it was warded by the [[Witches]] [[Lysandra, The White Witch]] and [[Anastasia Veron]], who had debts to [[Ophelia (Dead)]].

[[Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisin]] finds [[Salt]] hiding in the Bushes and protects him while other members of the crew stabilize the gears in the tower.  Everyone breathes in a lot of the smoke but are able to fix the immediate problem with the gears, and [[Locke Cordwainer]] spends a Mana to write down very detailed schematics, that he'll need help with.

Talking to [[Salt]], The crew learns that he used to be a member of [[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)]]'s crew, though havent seen him in months, and that he was tasked with looking after this Lighthouse.  He states that about a month ago, right around when Firebeard went missing, [[HMS Iron Titan]] attacked the Lighthouse with canon fire.

Firebeard used [[Reyka]] during the war, and made discoveries about the islands.  He imported materials, and covered each of the towers (one on each island) and made them look like lighthouses.  He then got witches to seal the towers, [[Lysandra, The White Witch]] and [[Anastasia Veron]] sealed this one.

The [[Greycoats]] dressed as Ghosts were messing with the tower the day before, causing the tremors and earthquakes.  [[Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisin]] presses [[Salt]] and he reveals there used to be a 4th island. [[Reyka'Suud]] to the southwest but it is no longer there.  [[Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisin]] confirms her father, [[Clive 'Ridge' Ridgely]] was on the island, and working on something to the south, when [[The Accident]] occurred about the same time the fourth island disappeared.

[[Rake, The Rat Prince]] and [[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] notice that the crew is finished with the repairs on the ship and signal them with flags.  [[Johan Kristoff]] has a super intense vision of the present, seemingly empowered greatly by the Tower:  [[The Red Darling]], one of [[Lady Friday]]â€™s ships, finds [[The Wayward Bounty]] and changes direction towards it with hostile vibes, but backs off into mists upon seeing [[The Barracuda]], moored on far side of adjacent island ([[Reyka'Norr]]).

[[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] notices a [[Greycoats]] scout watching them, and they decide to go back to the ship, to sail it south to look for their missing sellsword.  En route back to the ship, the crew notices the Owl [[Familiars]] keeping track of them again, they also find the same three tracks they've been seeing, fleeing towards [[The Calm Bay]] from a much larger force.

Back at the ship, someone used some First Aid on [[Tristan Winters]], but none of the crew fesses up to it.  The [[Makara]] is gone, probably eaten by the [[Aldani]] that [[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] angered.  Redpan and Rake gather its eggs, it was just nesting.

Treasure:
- Detailed Schematics of the Gears and whats missing.
- White Peacock
- [[Makara]] eggs.
