Part of [[Chapter 2 - Aramath]]
Previous Session: [[S4 - The Rescue]] Next Session: [[S2 - The Way to Aramath]]

[[Locke Cordwainer]] destroyed the two [[Rusty Flintlock]] and upgrades the firing and reloading mechanisms in [[Locke's Wheellock Gun]].

[[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] spends a Mana and uses [[Alchemy]] on the [[Waterlogged Pages]].

He gives up on the Letter of Marque and related pages and focuses on [[God's Eye]].  He Finds there are three specific places in three specific cave systems on three islands of [[Aramath]].
- [[God's Eye]] in [[Labyrinth Caverns]] on [[The Ox]]
- [[Devil's Tongue]] in [[Many-Faced Caves]] on [[The Coin]]
- [[Purgatory Steps]] in [[Vault Mines]] on [[The Lock]]
Somehow all of this related to three pieces of [[Davy Jones]]' treasure
- [[The Godkiller]]
- [[Tricorn of the Changeling]]
- [[The Damascus Blade]]

The crew buries the [[Cargo]] of [[Onyx Gemstones]] on [[Reyka'Maye]] but accepts a group Offer that maybe they didn't hide it as well as they'd hoped.
