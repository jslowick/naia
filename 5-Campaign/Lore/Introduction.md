## World of Naia

It’s said in ancient times, The Godesses Naia and Gaia fought bitterly, and Gaia was driven from the world.  The lands were taken as well, leaving nothing larger than you can see the ocean from (roughly 1 sq mile “width”) islands.  Naia is generically worshipped, and the world is divided into hundreds of Island-states, which some are a misnomer as they can control upwards of 20+ islands.



## Theme
![[Pasted image 20250912051527.png]]

Pirate and Nautical themes.  The world is mostly dark, but there is a spark of things bright and humor.  It is halfway between Grim and Noble, Heroes exist and things have changed, but there are many dangers as well that are not easily messed with.

## Haves and Have-nots
- No bows/slings, throwing knives, only ranged attacks are guns/cannon.
- Ships have men and women on them, there is a lot less sexism than IRL piracy/ships of the era
- Aether is special air that can give wind to a ship when it doesn’t have any
- Gunpowder comes from a specially harvested coral (then alchemized)
- Ironwood is what most ships are made of, traded for
- Normal compasses don’t point north, they point towards the middle of the map, a big whirlpool called the Beast
- The border between death and life is called the veil, ghosts are said to exist but other undead (skeletons/zombies etc) do not.
- Navigation is harder, in that stars change/move much faster
