Timeline - 19 years before [[S0 - Prequel]]

[[3-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Lanshire/Lanshire]] was looking for a fight with this pirate menace that had been getting worse throughout the years.  They found it when they were able to capture [[Ophelia (Dead)]], [[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)]]'s wife, and a powerful [[Witches|Witch]].  They burned her at the stake, and caused the pirates to unify and declare war on Lanshire.  

Lanshire of course was waiting for this, and struck back.  After years of fighting, the pirates retreating back to the [[1-Sea of Mists|Sea of Mists]], they lured the Lanshire navy into the [[Shipwreck Shoals]], and then towards the Pirate Island state of Tortuga.  Reports differ on how Firebeard was able to beat such a force, but he did.  Tortuga was renamed to [[Ashander's Folly]] after that.  

In the aftermath and surrender, lines and terms were drawn up.  Lanshire was severely weakened, and formed the [[Ostean Trade Consortium]], and additionally made slavery of [[Ren'Yu]] legal, as they lost so many men they needed the labor.  Part of the deal is Pirate islands off limits, and in return black and red flags will do less on the east side of trench
