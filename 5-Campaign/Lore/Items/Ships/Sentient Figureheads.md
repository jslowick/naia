Somehow [[Master Archeron]] has figured out a way to awaken some figureheads of Ships in [[Port Abalash]].

Before Archeron, sometimes figureheads would awaken, but it was a closely guarded secret if they did, and no one knew why.

Notable Figureheads
- [[Ja'nus]] - Newly Repaired Figurehead of [[The Wayward Bounty]]
