Painted by the famous [[Soothsayer]] artist [[Maris Eyerell 'The Sea's Eye']] and this portrait was commissioned by [[Winslow Firebeard]]. This was her 7th painting, and soon after this painting was finished, she disappeared. It could be very valuable to a collector but also could be revealing more secrets in the wrong hands. Her first painting depicted [[Ophelia]] being burned at the stake, which brought her to fame when it happened. It depicts [[Princess Sonya Tiverton]] *exactly* as she was found on [[The Wayward Bounty]].
