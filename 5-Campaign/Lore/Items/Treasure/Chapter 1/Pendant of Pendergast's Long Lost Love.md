1/ever – You may destroy this necklace to communicate with any [[Ghosts|Ghost]] you can name and identify, but will invoke the wrath of [[Pendergast (Dead)|Pendergast’s]] [[Ghosts|Ghost]] against you and your crew.

If you recover [[Pendergast (Dead)|Pendergast’s]] body and bury it with this necklace on the [[Grimfrost Knoll]], it will do something, but you don’t know what.
