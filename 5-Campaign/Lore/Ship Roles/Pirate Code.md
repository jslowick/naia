If the Black is raised, and the ship surrenders, Quarter is to be given

If the red is raised, there shall be no quarter

If your ship is missing for a Moon and a day, you are lost at sea.

Anyone falls behind, is left behind

If two ships attack the same targer

Parlay

Must take someone to captain

Any time a ship is taken, an offer to join the pirates should be offered.  All slaves or pressgangs should always be freed.

Pirate Lords flags are Skull and swords, Other pirate ships are Skull and Crossbones.

As a pirate you may use a false flag, but when you are found out or choose to pursue, either the red or black shall be raised.

Any ship known to have taken a Pirate Lord, sensitive maps/rudders, or one of the compasses, you must pursue and attack.

Raising the Black

East of the Trench:  If they surrender, All cargo on the ship, and any important ransomers are taken, the rest of the crew is left with the ship.

West of the Trench:  If they surrender, The crew must be left alive.  Marooned on any non pirate controlled island is acceptable.  The ship and cargo is free for the taking though often ships are not taken or sunk.

Rasing the Red

East of the Trench:  You may only raise the red vs a ship that has wronged you, got away, etc.  You may kill all of them, and sink the ship.

West of the Trench:  No restrictions, but the intention is stated upfront, and does not encourage surrender, obviously.

The Right of Parlay.[1]

Whenever a pirate is to be marooned, they are to be given a loaf of bread or hardtack, a bottle of water (if any exist), and a pistol loaded with a single shot.[8]

Artycle II, Section I, Paragraph VIII (sharing of the spoils).[1]

Artycle II, Section II, Paragraph I (whoever first spotted a treasure-laden ship could choose the best pistol for themselves).[1].

Every crew member is to have an equal share in any treasure found.[2]

The King could only be elected by unanimous vote by all Pirate Lords.[6]

The subsection 'Revenge' states that betrayal is punishable by death.[9]

Any person who refuses to serve aboard a pirate's ship must die.[10]
