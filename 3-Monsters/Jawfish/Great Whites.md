Larger [[Jawfish]], that hunt larger fish and people that stray into the deeper waters.  They are rarely too far from Islands, but can grow to great sizes and are extremely dangerous.  Known for their light colored underbellies and darker tops both of which help with their camouflage.  Sometimes Fins can be seen out of the water, but usually finding a great white comes from an ambush, the hard way.
