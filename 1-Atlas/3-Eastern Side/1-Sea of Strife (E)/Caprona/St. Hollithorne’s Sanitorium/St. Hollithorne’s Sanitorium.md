Nicknamed “The Hollow” by locals, St. Hollithornes occupies an small island of the main one in [[Caprona]].  It is a place for Lepers, those dying of Pitch Tremors, Lungrot, and the mentally insane.  No one goes there unless they must or are forced to.  The Doctors and Nurses are all members of [[Order of the Sacred Lantern]] and live there permanently as well.  The are rumors of terrible conditions and experiments going on at the Hollow, but nothing provable or concrete.
