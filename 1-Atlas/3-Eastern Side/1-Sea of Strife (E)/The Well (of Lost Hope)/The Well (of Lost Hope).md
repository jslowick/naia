Last Island before the [[2-Oshanan Trench|Trench]] on the northeast side of the [[1-Sea of Strife (E)]].  Said to once be a magical and wonderous well, that granted ship’s crews their every desire, it was used dry, and became fouled by the world’s greed.  It is a place to access fresh water easily, but almost all avoid the place, as it is considered horribly bad luck.

[[Locke Cordwainer]] marooned [[Victor 'The Mad' Maddington|Victor The Mad]] here on [[Johan Kristoff]]'s suggestion after the Mutiny aboard [[The Wayward Bounty|The Bounty]].
