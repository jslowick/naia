One of the largest and most powerful island states, they control most of the southeastern [[1-Sea of Strife (E)]].  They have a major [[Lanshire Reef|coral reef]] they use the slave labor of [[Ren'Yu]] to harvest, and the coral is a major  building material of the world.  Some of the rarer corals is ground up and used as gunpowder, while another is used to build stronger structures that the storms can’t destroy.  Most of the wood of the world is used on ships, so the coral is useful instead.
