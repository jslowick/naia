Notes:  Trades with [[Pirate Kingdom]] and [[Deephaven]]

Run by [[The Revenant Knight]], this group of Islands in the [[4-Sea of Night]] grows special lumber, [[Ironwood]], that is half the solution to crossing the [[2-Oshanan Trench]].  No one really knows why the [[Ironwood]] trees grow there and how, as it is a closely guarded secret that the Hexwood does not share.Â  Neither side ([[Pirate Kingdom]] or [[Ostean Trade Consortium|OTC]]) are willing to risk losing access to the wood.  The [[The Revenant Knight]] has a deal with [[The Deacon]] to trade wood for metal.
