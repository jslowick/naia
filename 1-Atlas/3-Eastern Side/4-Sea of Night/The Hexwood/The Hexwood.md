Group of Islands in the [[4-Sea of Night]] where the lumber for ships come from.  No one really knows why the [[Ironwood]] trees grow there and how, as it is a closely guarded secret that the Hexwood does not share.  Neither side ([[Pirate Kingdom]] or [[Ostean Trade Consortium|OTC]]) are willing to risk losing access to the wood, so the Island-state is treated with huge respect.
