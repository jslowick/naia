On the edge of the [[Sea of Night]] near [[Lanshire]], there is a humongous Tree on a single Island.  For years, [[Corwin Varchek]] would hang pirates there as a warning, but even the Lanshires won’t go near the tree anymore.  The tree has a Malevolent aura to it, and is said to be Haunted.  It used to be fully in the [[1-Sea of Strife (E)]], but the Sea of Night expanded to cover it.
