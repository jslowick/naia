The name for the extremely large whirlpool in the middle of the ocean, the [[2-Oshanan Trench]] leads into it from the north and south.  All normal compasses point there instead of north, though some say this was not always the case.  100+ years ago, the pirate [[Davy Jones]] was obsessed with it, and claimed there was an island in the center, he called [[The Belly of the Beast]].  He eventually disappeared there as well, and so some pirates call it [[Davy Jones|Davy Jones' Locker]] as well.
