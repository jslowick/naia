Ruins of a massive statue here, last Island before the [[Oshanan Trench]] on the Southwest Side in the [[4-Sea of Strife (W)]].  All that’s left is most of one leg, and the other foot.  No one really lives there, and some say its haunted, but its used as warning of the [[Oshanan Trench|Trench]].  Interestingly, the statue only has 4 toes on each foot.
