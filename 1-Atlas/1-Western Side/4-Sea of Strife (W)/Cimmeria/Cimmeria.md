One of the largest of the pirate controlled island-states, Cimmeria is a large caldera, with a semi active volcano in the middle.  Known for its metalsmiths, and crafting in general, is considered one of the prominent pirate islands.  Also where the Pirate King, Firebeard, came from.

Recently a couple of large meteors went in that direction, and one hit the main volcano, causing it to erupt.  The fate of Cimmeria at the moment is unknown.
