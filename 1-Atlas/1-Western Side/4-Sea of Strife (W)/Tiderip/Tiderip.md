Member: [[Neutral]]
Notes: Pirate and OTC Settlements

The last island before the [[2-Oshanan Trench|Trench]] and the [[Windspeaker Islands (W)]] on he northwest side of the [[4-Sea of Strife (W)]].  Horrible riptides, winds and unstable currents note this place and the wind and currents on one side of the island can be completely different than the other side.  [[Ostean Trade Consortium|OTC]] ships making the trek from [[Ereth'Yu]] with slaves consider this the point to get to to shake off Pirate pursuit or danger, and beyond it is [[3-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Windspeakers/Windspeakers|Windspeakers]] control.

Sometimes Windspeakers and Pirates will meet here as a sort of neutral ground for negotiations.
