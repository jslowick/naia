The last island before the Trench and the windspeaker Isles on he northwest side of the trench.  Horrible riptides, winds and unstable currents note this place and the wind and currents on one side of the island can be completely different than the other side.  OTC ships making the trek from Ereth’Yu with slaves consider this the point to get to to shake off Pirate pursuit or danger, and beyond it is windspeaker control.

Sometimes Windspeakers and Pirates will meet here as a sort of neutral ground for negotiations.
