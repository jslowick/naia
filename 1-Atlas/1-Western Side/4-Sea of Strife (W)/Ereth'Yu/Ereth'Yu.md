Large island chain inhabited by the non-human [[Ren'Yu]] (Slur: “U’s”) A race of primitives that live on southwest edge of the sea of strife.  Seen to be slow witted, with streaks of blue on their skin, and semi-functioning gills. [[Corites]], [[Merfolk]], and other [[4-Monsters|sea monsters]] seem to leave them alone, and thus they are captured and brought to [[Lanshire]] to harvest the coral there, which is sold to the [[Windspeakers]].
