A closely guarded secret of the western [[4-Sea of Strife (W)]], Coralhaven is where the main black market trade of coral is located.  While there is bits and pieces of useful coral on the west side of the [[2-Oshanan Trench]], the majority of coral is harvested in [[Lanshire]] and pirates have to steal shipments of it.  Coral is ground down as the main component is [[Gunpowder]].
