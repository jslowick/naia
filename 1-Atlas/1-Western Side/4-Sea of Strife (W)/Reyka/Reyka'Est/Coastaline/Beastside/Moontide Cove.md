A relatively safe cove on [[Reyka'Est]] to take cover from storms and currents in right to the north of where the [[Haunted Cliffs]] get dangerously high.  The tides are exaggerated in the cove, and can lead to a ship being stuck or washed away during exceptionally low or high tides.  Location where [[The Wayward Bounty]] first took refuge to repair in [[S1 - A Bad Storm]].
