Thought haunted for years, the Southern Ruins on Reyka’Est were the hideout of [[Merrick the Grey]] and his “Pirate Hunters” now called [[Greycloaks]].  They wore masks and costumes to fool others into thinking they were ghosts.  [[Winslow Firebeard|Firebeard]] never returned to the south of the island after an accident there.

[[Clive 'Ridge' Ridgely]] was here when the accident happened.
