A small cluster of islands in the [[4-Sea of Strife (W)]] just west of [[The Beast]], that used to have a large pirate presence and fort on it before [[The Great War]].  Now they are uninhabited and said to be haunted.  [[Winslow Firebeard|Firebeard]] is said to have left the islands because of the ghosts, and forbid building a settlement there.  Extremely dangerous currents and tides, along with [[Merfolk|Mer-sign]] have kept these islands avoided.
