Located deep in the [[2-Sea of Storms]], a cluster of Calderas and Atolls that the outer ones shield some from the weather.  Said to once be under Pirate control, cruelly, until a Storm took the [[Rime, Ancient Mariner|Mariner]] and the people were able to free themselves from his tyranny.  Now well known for their Alcohol.  [[Pirate Ships]] are not welcome in Tarsus.

Extremely difficult to navigate, between the Storms, clouds, underwater volcanos, reefs, and ruins.  No compasses, not even [[Magical Compass]] work there, they tend to to just spin slowly.  Sailors swear the Island rotates, and many a ship has left port to return to the [[4-Sea of Strife (W)]] and said to accidently head in the opposite direction.

By necessity, and lack of landmass, they have developed saltwater farming techniques that work in their Atolls. Tarsian Wine & Spirits is highly sought after in [[Lanshire]] and beyond, and thus [[Ostean Trade Consortium|OTC]] Merchants make the dangerous trek here.
