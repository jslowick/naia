Naia used to have a lot of lighthouses, but somewhere along the centuries, these [[Nettles]] figured out what they were, and used their bioluminesense to confuse ships and run them into traps, shoals, coral, etc.  Jellyfish like, many can float above and below the sea, and are very venomous and poisonous.  Many can be found in the [[4-Sea of Night]], but they exist all over Naia.  Can be harvested for [[Aether]] if they can float.  Small ones, called Will-o-Wisps are sometimes used for lanterns, but they can attract others, so they are used sparingly.
