There are rumors of a being called the Lantern Bearer.  It resembles a large cloaked figure holding a bright lantern.  Some say it’s a [[Ghosts]], others say it’s a strange [[Falselights]].  Many consider it an Omen, whether good or bad, and the more supersticious believe ships should change direction (towards or away) when it’s seen.  Its only ever seen at night, and when a ship approaches, it tends to disappear.
