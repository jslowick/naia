There are rumors of a being called the Ferryman.  It resembles a large cloaked figure holding a strange lantern.  Some say it’s a [[Ghosts|Ghost]], others say it’s a strange [[Falselights|Falselight]] and some even say its the God of the [[Order of the Sacred Lantern]].  Many consider it an Omen, whether good or bad, and the more supersticious believe ships should change direction (towards or away) when it’s seen.  Its only ever seen at night, and when a ship approaches, it tends to disappear.
