[[Order of the Sacred Lantern]] was founded here, as a place for those with wasting diseases to come be at peace and remove the burden on their families.  Later, [[3-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Lanshire/Lanshire|Lanshire]] discovered that the larger islands [[The Hexwood]] had special [[Ironwood]] trees and repurchased it from the order after "gifting" it to them, allowing them to build Torchlight Abbey, and acquire some ships.
