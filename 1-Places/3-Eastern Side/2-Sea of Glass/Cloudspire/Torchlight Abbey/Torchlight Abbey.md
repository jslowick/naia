Torchlight Abbey, built by the [[Order of the Sacred Lantern]] is miraculously is built at the gap between two spires, held up like a suspension bridge.   [[St. Brigit's Torch]] is the Labotory and [[St. Brigit's Lantern]] is the school they train their order at.  Together the two spires make up the Abbey.
