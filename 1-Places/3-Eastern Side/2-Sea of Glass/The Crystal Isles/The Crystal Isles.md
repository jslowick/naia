Notes: Different Islands with different leanings

Where most gems are from in all of Naia, deep in the [[2-Sea of Glass]].Â  Crystal Spires jut from the ocean and grow the crystals, the vast majority of which are flawed, but some that are pure are valuable and some even say can contain magic.

Spires:
- [[The All Seeing]]
- [[The Amber Spire]]
- [[The Emerald Citadel]]
