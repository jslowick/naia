Notes:

Last Island before the [[2-Oshanan Trench|Trench]] on the Southeast side of the [[1-Sea of Strife (E)]], Glowing.  Past that to the south is the [[4-Sea of Night]], where the sun doesn’t come out at all, so it acts like a magical lighthouse.  Pirates often wait in lure here for those OTC foolhardy enough to try to make the run from [[Ereth'Yu]] directly to [[2-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Lanshire/Lanshire]].
