Westmost Sea, the Storms here get worse and worse the farther west you go, and more likely to sea/find [[The Maelstrom]], which can sink even a [[6-Dreadnaught|Dreadnaught]].  

Past the Storms, there is said to be the mythical [[Strait of Kafir]] that leads to land as vast as the oceans, though no one has successfully found it and returned.
