Notes:

Large crescent moon shaped Islands in the [[2-Sea of Storms]].  The Gulf it surrounds is remarkably reasonable to sail, vs the rest of the Sea.  The Islands are very mountainous, and there is a large freshwater inland sea, that is deep enough to sail around on.

If religion was more popular in the rest of Naia, this Island-State would be considered Heretical.  The Island is divided between two factions, Heralds of the Storm and The Moonlit Path.  Both of which are said to have forsaken Naia in search of new gods.  "Her time is over" is a common mantra.

Some Pirates come here, due to the close proximity to [[1-Places/1-Western Side/2-Sea of Storms/Tarsus/Tarsus]], and the Island-State makes a tidy profit marking up Tarsian Wine & Spirits to the Pirates.
