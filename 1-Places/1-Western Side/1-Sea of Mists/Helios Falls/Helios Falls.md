Notes:

Large mountainous island on the edge of the [[1-Sea of Mists]], where a large fresh waterfall comes from tall above in the mists.  The water itself is said to invigorate you on longer journeys so sometimes [[Pirate Kingdom|Pirates]] and [[3-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Windspeakers/Windspeakers|Windspeakers]] alike detour here.
