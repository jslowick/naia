Magical Lighthouses on [[1-Places/1-Western Side/4-Sea of Strife (W)/Aramath/Aramath]] (4 of them) from ancient past, that allow supernatural viewing of ships trying to pass Aramath.  Since [[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)|Firebeard’s]] disappearance and the strife of the pirate kingdom, the Lighthouses have been taken over by the infamous White Witch, [[Lysandra, The White Witch]].
