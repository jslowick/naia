Found in the [[Dockside]] district of [[1-Places/1-Western Side/4-Sea of Strife (W)/Aramath/The Coin/Edgecoin/Edgecoin|Edgecoin]] on [[2-People/Neutral/Amarath/The Coin/The Coin|The Coin]] in [[Aramath]].

Used to be barracks for city guard, before the defense of [[Aramath]] was unified in the [[Forts]].  Now mostly Captains police their own men, or people go to the [[Shipwreck - The Fallen Angel]] to fight.  What little guard there is, is like a volunteer fire department.
