Thought haunted for years, the Southern Ruins on [[Reyka'Est]] were the hideout of [[Merrick the Grey]] and his “Pirate Hunters” now called [[Greycoats]].  They wore masks and costumes to fool others into thinking they were ghosts.  [[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)|Firebeard]] never returned to the south of the island after an accident there, giving them a good hideout.

[[Clive 'Ridge' Ridgely]] was there during [[The Great War]] when the accident happened.
