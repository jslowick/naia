There is a cove on [[Reyka'Est]] that lures boats in from the harsh currents of [[The Pull of the Beast]], but is dangerous in its own right.  The coral isn’t native to [[Reyka]], but seems to flourish here, and [[Aldani]], a [[Cecaelia]] and many [[Corites]] have been spotted.  Under the water there may be more treasures to explore here, if you are willing to deal with the [[4-Monsters]].
