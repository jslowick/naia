When [[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)|Firebeard]] was using the [[1-Places/1-Western Side/4-Sea of Strife (W)/Reyka/Reyka]] Isles during the War, it's said he crafted 4 lighthouses, in the style of the ones on [[1-Places/1-Western Side/4-Sea of Strife (W)/Aramath/Aramath]].Â  The one on [[Reyka'Est]] has been shelled and partially destroyed, revealing an ancient tower and clockwork mechanisms from ancient past the lighthouse was protecting or hiding.  The Damaged mechanisms cause earthquakes on the island, and are guarded by a [[Smoke Monster]].
