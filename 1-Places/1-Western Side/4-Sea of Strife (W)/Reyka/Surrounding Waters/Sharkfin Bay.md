The calmer waters around [[Reyka'Maye]] the go to the other [[1-Places/1-Western Side/4-Sea of Strife (W)/Reyka/Reyka]] Islands, that are infested with [[Jawfish]].  Some types that aren’t usually even found in the [[4-Sea of Strife (W)|Sea of Strife]].  There is also [[Merfolk|Mer-sign]], and the two of these mean wrecks are rarely if ever recovered or salvaged due to the danger.

[[Johan Kristoff]] had a vision that there is a large [[6-Dreadnaught]] sunk in Sharkfin Bay recently.
