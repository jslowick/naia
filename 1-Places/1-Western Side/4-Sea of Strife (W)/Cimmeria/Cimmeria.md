Notes:

One of the largest of the pirate controlled island-states in the western [[4-Sea of Strife (W)]], Cimmeria is a large caldera, with a once dormant volcano in the middle.  Known for its metalsmiths, and crafting in general, is considered one of the prominent pirate islands.  Also where the Pirate King, [[Winslow Firebeard (Missing)]], came from.

Recently a couple of large meteors went in that direction, and one hit the main volcano, causing it to erupt.  The fate of Cimmeria at the moment is unknown.
