soon as johan takes drugs again, selene needs a favor in return, she needs a lamp from XXXX in Ashanders Folly.

She warns him about the smoke.  How it charged his visions, and can burn him out of it for good.  Your friends might try to get you to go to Smoke Islands.  Do not, you will lose your prophecy, and only a return to the crystal isles will bring it back.

She shows him a memory of the iron titan, and him breathing in the smoke, and her warning him about it, to not go near it again.

You catch a part she didn’t intend too, her own memory where she is closing the bottle and puts it back on the shelf, and looks outside at the smoking volcano.  Something to do with your memory is on Cimmeria…
