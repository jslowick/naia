The Windspeakers make a deal with the Old Ones of the Deep, part of the deal is the ability to resurrect beings, they do such with their Archon, but he returns different, and without his powers.

Blackjack uses it to return Ophelia, to get Firebeard gone to finally end this pirate problem, and do what Ashander couldn’t before.   

Blackjack eventually also returns his Uncle Ashander, but leaves him chained up on his ship (worried about losing power?  Don’t want to reveal resurrection powers?).

Firebeard is given Ophelia back if he agrees to abdicate his throne and disappear by Blackjack.  Long before he does so, he writes to his two daughters, and hides his “will” in the the Tivertons vault.  Hes able to do this via his powerful Soothsayer, the Sea’s Eye who tells him it will not be safe in any Pirate hands.

Firebeard and Ophelia leave for the strait of Kafir (or maybe cross the endless sea)

Callisto resides in the Secret Garden past the Hall of Mirrors on the Vale of Whispers in the Sea of Mists.  (Gloomshark eating wayward bounty somewhere on this plotline?)  Calypso has taken up residence in the the Obsidian Eidolon, at the Ebon Keep on the Black Sand Beach in the Sea of Night.

Each letter is sealed by Lillith and only the recipient (or lillith) can open it, and it needs to be hand delivered in person. (Firebeard calls upon the witches debts, and the code to implore this happens.

Ophelia has no more powers and is also “different”, but Firebeard doesn’t care.  She does though, and pulls ancient debts to Lysandra and Persephone, to bring back her coven for revenge on Blackjack and to combat the Armada that he’s building.  She is unaware of the rift between the two.

Persephone and Lysandra had a falling out post Ophelia’s burning.  

Pandora and Rime are together, get caught up in the feud

Rime takes makes a deal with Persephone to survive Davy Jones

Erin is Rime and maybe Pandoras child (Something removed witchblood here?)

Pandora takes rimes child (hers too?) away on Lysandras sayso

Rime imprisons Pandora in a box hides 4 keys 

Lysandra imprisons Rime in a sarcophagus and tosses him in the sea of storms

           Rime deals with old one windspeakers dealt with

Persephone to stab Lysandra with a Nightshard

Lysandra makes an Eldritch pact with an Old One, and is able to suck all the power from her sister to survive but Mysandra loses her witchiness, and the two sisters break apart, this is why she needs to feed on souls/looks young.  

This would have escalated further, but Lillith, Ophelia’s sister steps in, and stops things.  Making Pacts with Old ones is FORBIDDEN. (She then returns to the Emerald Citadal)

Unable to decide between Firebeards two daughters Callisto and Calypso, and the coven splits.  Umbral Convenant following Persephone (and Calypso) and the the Ashen Covenant following Lysandra( and Callisto).  Covenant is all the non major witch followers, and coven is just the witches.  The Witch Sisters don’t know about the war or their father yet.

Lysandra goes to Aramath and makes an alliance with Merrick for an army.  She takes over Key, givens Lock to the OTC, and is barely holding on to Ox, and havent taken Coin yet because of Persephone.  She uses the 3 lighthouses, to find pandora, but burns them out/messes with them because she didn’t have all 4 and overclocked them.

Lysandra is able to convince Andromeda to meddle in the affair of the surfacers, and she sets up in Reyka Bay and sinks the Iron Titan there, (like Johan predicted), but is Andromeda is wounded in the battle.  She uses the towers to do something, and the Titan shells one or more in return.  Andromeda has a Chuul, Caecellia sharks, etc working for her.  (Tony vision again on titan sinking)

Persephone travels to Cimmeria to find Callisto’s children before the Ashen Covenant can hide them.  She captures Merrowyn Rask (ryans sister) but Harlan escapes.  

Persephone makes a Pact with an Old One and turns Merrowyn into a living trap that will remove Witches powers,  but doing so kiils her mind and soul,  Persephone pursues Lysandra to Ashander’s Folly, but Lysandra wasn’t there anymore, she was only delivering Pandora’s Message to the Four Fathers.  She leaves Merrowyn with the her Umbral Covenant, and makes more nightshards, returning to Aramath to battle Lysandra, but is betrayed by Natasha and imprisoned in The Long Shadows figurehead.

Persephone returns to Aramath and orders Wei-Lin go to Tarsus to try to find/free Rime.  If Rime isnt freed, their coven will not be able to stand against Pandora, who she forsees returning.  She begins to work against Lysandra there with Wilton and others.  Natasha learns that Persephone is the witch that hurt Wilton, and uses the Cinderwoven Effigy to trap her in her Figurehead on her ship, the Long Shadow.

The Mother of worms forsees that either Victor or Nicolai will capture the Aurora, and access to the will, Nicolai makes a deal with Victor may the best captain win.  Victor wins, but doesn’t want witnesses to his plans with sonya, ordering the ship sunk after shes offboard.  This causes the mutiny.  Victor uses the Nightshard Persephone gave him to stab Winters, to hide Sonya, either to return for her later or maybe Nicolai gets her.

Victor later opens pandora’s box,  will return with Pandora in a later chapter, intent on revenge (Battle between Victor and Mad Dog, Pandors kills major pirate or neutral town maybe? 

Anastasia is happy where she is, and unwilling to rejoin warring covens, and her attempts to kidnap the “Noble” that will control Firebeards destiny have not paid fruit, or so she thinks.  Rake escapes on the Aurora with Sonya.  Natasha has learned of Rake and been writing him letters under the guise of Wilton.

Wilton used to work for Lysandra spying on Anastasia and others.  Persephone “converted” him to her side as a double agent, hence the torture.  Natasha works for Wilton but learns of her brother.  Natasha goes to Ox when Lysandra claims power there to work against her.  She and Wilton have an artifact to capture Lysandra in and are working with Persephone.  

Natasha learns about Persephone, and what she did to Merrowyn and to Wilton while working with her against Lysandra.  She becomes anti-witch, and uses the scroll to bind Persephone capture her and imprision her in her Ship’s figurehead.

           The Midnight Rose, Nicolai and Mother of Worms return to aramath, chasing the Wayward Bounty.  The Albatross is burned to free Persephone, who in return uses the nightshard she was saving for Lysandra on Nasha in a fit of rage.

Main part of navy left with Pirate Lord Jonas Blacktide, to the Sea of Storms, convinced by the White Witch. Lock and Key and most of Ox.

Coins Navy and whats left of Ox are controlled by Quinn **“**Harlequin” Harwick, who was Jonas’ second in command, but was actually a spy for Lord Masque,  Harlequin defected with what ships he could to Southfort, Coinside.  Detriech’s death is blamed on the Wayward Bounty, and so he sends Captain Savvy of the Reaper’s Touch after them.
