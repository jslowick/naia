**Yidrin “Pyro” Pyrelle**  
_Master Gunsmith, Exiled to the Asylum_

Once famed for his ingenious firearms and meticulous craftsmanship, Yidrin Pyrelle earned the nickname “Pyro” not for recklessness but for his bold experiments with powder efficiency and ignition systems. His reputation drew commissions from nobles across Lanshire — including **Lord Corwin Varchek II**.

When Varchek demanded a custom wheellock musket on short notice, Yidrin refused politely, claiming his schedule and standards would not allow for such rushed work. Days later, his workshop erupted in a fireball that tore through half his district. Dozens of “witnesses” swore they saw Pyrelle ignite the blast himself in some fit of lunacy. Within a week he was dragged before a tribunal, branded unstable, and committed to St. Erasmus’ Asylum.

Among the artisan guilds and commonfolk, whispers persist that the explosion was no accident but a calculated strike by Varchek to remove an inconvenient craftsman and seize his designs. Yidrin himself swears he saw Varchek’s agents near his workshop that night — though such words, coming from a man branded _mad_, carry little weight.

Now, Pyrelle sits in the asylum, still sketching firearm designs on scraps of parchment, awaiting the day someone uncovers the truth behind his fall.

“They say Lord Varcheck paid Yidrin a king’s purse to make him a weapon like no other… but the gunsmith turned him down. Days later, Pyrelle’s workshop went up in fire and smoke, and the only man seen fleeing the blaze was Pyrelle himself.”
