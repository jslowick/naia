While it wasn’t on Aramath, you ran into Amina Okoro in Dasa in the Eastern Isles.  Amina is a boxer that worked for a bookie you ended up owing quite a bit of money to, Edgar “Ledger” Hawke.  You also remember Barricade, a famous OTC boxer that was also on Dasa at the time, he fought for the Varcheks. While he didn’t work for Ledger then, but clearly things have changed.  If Amina is here, then Ledger must be as well.  He’s not known for forgiving debts, regardless of time, so maybe stay away from him and lay low for a bit?  Luckily, she doesn’t seem to remember you, as her eyes are scanning the room for threats. She does seem to linger on some of your other  pirate crew a bit, pointing towards them, and whispering something unintelligible to Barricade.
