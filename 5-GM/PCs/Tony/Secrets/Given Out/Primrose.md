You didn’t recognize her at first, the Gibbet and imprisonment has taken a serious toll on her.  But it nagged at you that this small, diminutive woman outlived everyone else here.  This is the vampire, Primrose.  You vaguely remember her being a friend of Selene’s, and how both of them would feed on you when you were stoned out of your mind.  Primrose would book travel on ships and feed off of them for entertainment as well.  You last saw her leaving with a pirate ship called “The Enigma”, which brings your mind and prophecy back to the wrecked ship and sharks.  She is in bad shape now, and would need to feed badly to recover.  She would need to feed an energy to survive barely, and a mana to be able to help and recover.  Of course, you know she’s dangerous and you could just leave her to her fate as well, but what would Selene say?
