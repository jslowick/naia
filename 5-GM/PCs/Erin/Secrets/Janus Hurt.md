After your alone, Ja'nus reveals he took a little more damage then initially revealed.  He says the repairs made are failing and cant dry out due to the storms, and he's going a little crazy.  He'll need help from Master Archeron in Port Abalash to fix this for good, but doesnt want the rest of the crew to know, as mad figureheads have sunk ships before.  OFFER: Dont tell PCs as well.
