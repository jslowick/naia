To be given: [[Arcanist Emporium]] when talking about locke's gun, and a gunsmith that could help.



You recognize the name Yidrin Pyrelle, though anyone that knew him well knew him as Pyro.  He was evicted from his first shop in the Guildquarter, as he was too loud with explosions and fire.  As a kid, you would go look in his windows (you weren't allowed inside), and some of the guns he had on display inspired you to this day, and you looked up to him as an influence.

His love of fire aside, you find it hard to believe the story he's accused of, much less that he would destroy his guns in an explosion, unless he really has gone completely crazy...
