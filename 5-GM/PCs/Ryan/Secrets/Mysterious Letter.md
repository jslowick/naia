H-

I need to speak with you.  It’s about your family.  It’s direly important.  Come to the XXXX at Port Abalash. 

-X

This brings back a memory.  When you were young at the Orphanage, you made friends with a boy, that no one else liked.  His name was Axel, but you couldn’t spell it, and thought it started with an X and that’s what you called him.  No one else really knew that.  He was convinced his parents were alive, a dream a lot of kids shared.  He wanted to go find them, and tried to get you to come with him, but you didn’t.  Now, out of the blue, this letter.
