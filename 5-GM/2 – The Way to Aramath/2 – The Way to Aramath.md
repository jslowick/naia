## Scene 1: The Negotiations(30m)

Recap, fid being fishy.
Tony Vision retcon – forgot the prodigal son on aramath

Victoria brings the two windspeakers up too early
Penny looks at primrose and pales, she would like to renegotiate.  You cant leave me with that monster

Fid smalltalk about Barracuda, Lord Masques ship

Erin – wants to go below decks to search for a compass
Ryan – wants a worm
Wants: Windspeakers, Crew
Gives: Search his ship, Salts Bird, Violin, worm?

[[Hellstring Dirge]]

Won it in a game on Aramath, at the Dead Man’s Hand.Said to be won by Joel “Jolly” Roger vs the Devil himself, First Mate to Davy Jones. Was practicing with it before the shark attack.  (This part sounds a little fishy to PCs)  The old captain, Roderic Vance refused to let him play it on the ship after a while.  Theres a bit of a longing to keep it, but greed of keeping the full ransom is in play as well.

## Scene 2: Below Decks(30m)
Can move this to post being boarded if wanted/needed


Will agree to Tony going below, Neve can sneak as well.  Erin hmm

Primrose is hiding something below decks, that she got for selene  Most of the hold has been rearranged, theres a large glass box in it, swirling in Mist something in it. (Djinn) Primrose says its hers, and she didn’t go to the Sea of Mists and then deal with a shipwreck, then fight a witch for nothing.  She warns she will fight if PCs pursue this further.

[[The Animus' Box]]

If tony, he gets bamboozled by primrose, if anyone else, compel vs primrose that she feeds on them, and they forget what they see

If only neve sees

Squeak… squeak… master, master… big box, iron corners, rivets tight. Glass shines, fog inside, swirling, whispering. Claws? No Hands… yes, yes hands press walls, pale, twitchy. Rest hides… mist lost, can’t see, can’t smell. Feels wrong, feels hungry. Squeak-squeak… don’t like it, master. Want to scamper, want to hide in dark cracks, far from the box…

## Scene 3: The Red Darling (1h+)
As you end the negotiations and both begin to sail in different directions, the Red Darling shows up.  It starts pursuing the Animus.  The storm begins to pick up, and the water is choppy and bad.


BATTLE MAP

Naval Battle - explain naval rules again
[[Naval Combat Quick]]

Lookout triangles
Left:  The Choppy water there is surface only, and the currents arent nearly as bad there as it looks.
Middle:  The calmness in the center is the ocean pulling back for a big wave or waves, beware.
Right: The current pull here is stronger than it looks but if you can crest the wave quickly, you could gain momentum on the downside.

## Scene 4: The Midnight Rose(1h)
If no time (10:45 cutoff maybe?), tease midnight rose as another attack ship

A couple hours later, as you are limping towards Aramath, Another ship on the horizon, heading strait towards you at night.


[TONY COMPEL] Drug withdrawal

If they run, hard rolls to escape.  If they escape, they dpnt see who, will be there or pulling in to coin at the same time.

Laughs about if they run, if they talk about being attacked by red, do they have proof?  Someone unaligned that’s word is good?

You must have been mistaken on what ship attacked you.  These things happen.


It’s the Midnight Rose, captain Von Drakk wants to meet

Meeting on his ship, you provide the dinner

Locke remembers Victor talking about him one saying he was easier to deal with when he was impressed.
 - Ryan impress him with food and drink
- others can help with other things 


After failing to catch the Aurora, Victor returned to Mother of Worms unsuccessful, who got on board at Freeport.  They then learned of the OTC chasing The Wayward Bounty towing the Aurora, and went after them, they wisely avoided the storm, which delayed them a while, then mother of worms sought out the Bounty to see if they got what they needed.

[[The Midnight Rose]] for crew list


Just Von Drakk and his valet, Grimes.  Mother of Worms is in the next room, listening in

Ryan Feels presence of powerful witch, Mother of Worms

RYAN SECRET [[5-GM/PCs/Ryan/Secrets/Mother of Worms|Mother of Worms]]

Surprise mutiny, he holds Locke accountable for previous deals.  Wants to know what he found.

Winters, offers to take him to be healed

Wants to know about aurora and says you must uphold deals made under the Bounty

Asks about Sonya, will give more info back if they talk about her.  They know because Sonya has a small mirror, which the Mother of Worms could see through.

TONY VISION – Witchs can use mirrors

If told aramath, the white witch controls most of it now, be careful, I am no friend of hers either.  I personally stabbed her through the heart once, she didn’t die.  Maybe turn her over to the OTC, their burnings tend to stick.  Maybe not though, who wants to grovel at their feet.

Another competition?  Your predecessor was more fun.

Im off to The Sea of Storms, but when im done there, im going back to Ashander’s Folly to call for council, I expect you to have gone and confessed, I mean registered your mutiny by then.  The threat is implicit.

Interrupted by “Barnacle” who is a ren’yu and comes in soaking wet, about an important matter, leaves just Grimes here (if ryan wants to try to get in to other room)

Ryan can meet mother of worms, long as Grimes is distracted.

Smalltalk with erin about her dad:

Grimes knows: Sir Braxton Crowley, Gianna’s dad.  They were both OTC back in the day, both served on the HMS Abigail, captained by the insufferable Braxton Reed.  This was when they were both young and stupid.  Your father took his first name as an insult when he defected all those years later.


Smalltalk with Rake:

Odette “Scurry” Skurlain saw Rakes rat, and feels a kindred spirit

Shes missing the pinky on her right hand

She wants to be the Spider Queen and seeks the regalia.  Does Rake seek the Rat Kings Regalia as well?  Neither have been seen in some time.   Us Vermin should stick together.  You can trust Mother, worms rats and spiders, all together strong.

Scurry wants Rake to bring something to Aramath, deliver it to Corvus, the figurehead of the Long Shadow.  Mother promised it’d be there.

About backpack sized burlap sack, Tied with many, many knots.  Inside, wrapped in cloth, is Worm-eaten book, the book as a rune bonding on it that Rake doesn’t know what happens if its opened.  Ryan might.  Maybe a test by mother of worms.

## End of Session

Pull up to Edgecoin, on Aramaths “The Coin” town looks normal, ships in dock, including the Domino  (Midnight rose if no time for it)

There are MUCH less patrolling ships than there used to be, half the Pirates ships used to be here and they appear to be gone, or not patrolling the south side anymore.
