You’ve hated Wally Bancroft since McGillicutty Cobb picked him to be his successor.  Didn’t matter he had years on you, and was actually fairly good, you were PROMISED it next.  Every ship so far, none have let you be the Helmsmyn.  You’d like to think it was calculated, that a slight nudge overboard during the mutiny, but if it was premeditated, you wouldn’t have forgotten about the compass.  Registered Helmsmyn are given a magical compass, that can lead them through Shipwreck Shoals, to Ashander’s Folly.  Wally is probably drowned though (although you did see him grab onto a piece of Flotsam), and you’ve been faking it since.  It’s Pirate Code that if the Helmsmyn loses a compass, they are removed from the position, and you doubt the new Captain will take pity on you.  You will not be able to travel to Ashander’s Folly without it, or help.  Your “Medallion” showing that you graduated from Universa Arbitrum is your replaced special gear.
