The White Peacock gives you pause as a memory comes flooding back.  When you were young, you found an old hat in  Ridge’s attic (Even you called him Ridge), and had declared yourself Pirate Queen.  For your found-day, Ridge gave you a white peacock feather for the hat.  Something you hadn’t seen before, nor have since until today.  Ridge didn’t speak of the war much, but that day, with a little too much Rum in his gut, and a desire to impress you, he told you about being stuck on an island, with his foot mangled (Eventually the Doc cut it off), and having little to do but man a lighthouse.  The lighthouse, he said, brought fought the ghosts of the Island, and he found ghost peacocks there, the Island had normal ones too, but these were different.  White sufferinger covering, he made a whole cape of white white feathers, but lost it later while he was recovering from the amputation.  He said the birds reclaimed it.  You weren’t sure of the truthfulness of the story, but now are SURE Clive “Ridge” Ridgely was on this island during the war.
