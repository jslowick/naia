CHALLENGE

Access to Lighthouse.

Fixes lense, reassembles, and gets zapped, gets a lot smarter, needs one more ancient tech to complete it.

Exhales some of the living smoke its been living in his lungs, goes back in

Able to see that lysandra was looking for Pandora (maybe just a witch)

Able to look at one (3?) other places. 

Notes on gears make more sense now, also suddenly know whats wrong with the clocktower in freehold

  Sees the Windspeakers bring someone back for a test for corwin. remove water, treasure, lighthouse problems and solutions

Eureka moment in brain, need to find some more ancient technology that isnt a lighthouse or the towers on Reyka.  Only place you can definitively think of is Smoke Island, since theres a connection to the smoke and the tech.
