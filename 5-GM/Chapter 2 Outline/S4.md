Sent those looking for Rake on a wild rat-chase to Tarsus, so stay away from there.

Someone has been helping her, thought it was you guys (actually persephone’s group)

### Scene 4: The Boneways

The tunnel splits ahead into two dripping arches, the air thick with the stink of brine and rot.

To the **left**, the stone floor pulses with a fine **spray of saltwater**, as though the sea itself is breathing through the cracks. The walls are scarred with long gouges, and in the dark, you swear you hear the faint **clicking of many legs on stone**, which you only hope could be rats.

To the **right**, the air grows heavier, humid and sour, carrying the **reek of spoiled rum and rotten fruit**. A sluggish trail of sticky green residue follows along the floor, glistening faintly, as though it remembers the taverns it once dripped through. The air here is thick—too thick—like the tunnel is solidifying it.
