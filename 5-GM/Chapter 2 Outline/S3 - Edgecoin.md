## Scene 1: The Serpents End

![[Excalidraw/Edgecoin|Edgecoin]]

Erin or Tony, would you like to spend a Fate Point to have been here sometime before the Bounty?

The Southfort on Oxside is dark, and looks empty. On Coinside there are some lights, but does not look full either.

Dockmaster, [[Dockmaster Dietrich Royce]] fees are exorbitant, why?
Needs list of crew, cargo, more questions than normal
Sabotage, and Edgecoin isnt what it used to be.  Enemies everywhere.

Portmaster, his mother, [[Portmaster Eliza Royce]], will rail on them for asking, when the Coin is the only free island left.

Notable Ships in Port

[[The Hell Hound]], Mad Dog Lucas’s Ship
[[The Midnight Rose]] (if not s2)
[[The Domino]]
[[The Albatross]]

RYAN SECRET - [[Ashen Covenant]]

Crew wants to spend the money and go enjoy leave/city

Bartender [[Jara Pike]]

[[Frankie '2-Beans']] gets thrown through a window as they approach

If they ask about a doc, none here, they get recruited too fast.  Port Abalash has docs, and theres on that doest like sharing treasure equally in Oxmouth, but id stay away from old Goldfingers.


Maria and Theodoro are from here originally, Maria from Coin and Theodoro from Ox
Theodoro is secretly working for Persephone.
Maria is shady and hint to the PCs she’s hiding things.

BILL SECRET - [[Wilton]]

Knows an expert on caves, [[Dr. Fenric 'Pebbletongue' Pebbleton]] (Don’t call him pebble tongue, he hates that) that works at the [[Arcanist Emporium]].  Normally doesnt like pirates much, but will probably make an exception that he owes Wilton a favor.

Willing to buy all firebeards stuff and hold/promise, or store it but not buy

Would buy rubies for 100 but worth double that in cimmeria

Business partner/wife, Wei Lin, is away to tarsus in the sea of storms
Apprentice has gone to Oxmouth and hasn’t returned

[[Familiars]] (White Snake named [[Reviss]]) in cage, asks [[Rake, The Rat Prince]] to be let out

Wants help delivering cargo to the Commodore and his brother of Oxmouth and the Portmaster of Safe Harbor (though you will have to go not in pirate colors there).  Will pay handsomely for either, as he is late with shipments but has no help left.

Recruits Theodoro and Maria to deliver the Dockmaster, Detrik Crowe (known Lysandra sympathizer) who ends up dead.  Maria skips out on delivery to deal with the loan shark.

## Scene 3: The Arcanist Emporium

[[Dr. Fenric 'Pebbletongue' Pebbleton]] (recognizes [[Gianna Zarina Celeste Roisin]] from [[Freehold]], at [[Universa Arbitrum]]

HATES being called Pebbletongue

Doesn’t like pirates, even with Wiltons connection
Challenge to get inside.

[[Wren Tamsford]], his assistant is more forthcoming
She wants to see Locke's gun.  Talks about a famous gunsmith, but hes a little crazy Yidrin ‘Pyro’ Pyrelle, a guest of the lantern on tarsus.  Pity, used to be amazing. If your ever there, look him up, if you have any sway with the lantern.

MIKE SECRET: [[Pyro]]


Erin sees a compass.  “Don’t worry it doesn’t work, its just a replica commision for a museum in [[freehold]]

Know about god’s eye, but its on the next island over, “The Ox”
People in here recently asking same questions, were from Barracuda (Lord Masques)

Good chance of fight here, willing to push it to 3 days at the Shipwreck

[[The Hell Hound]] Crew here


Returning to the Docks/Ship, Dietrich is murdered, and PCs are questioned as he had just sent them a note about their ship being a nuisance because of the storms.  They tell the PCs not to leave port and their ship will be impounded until its cleared up.

PCs realize it was either Theodoro or Maria or both that did it.


## Scene 5 - Crossing the Missing Eighth
Move to S4 if no time




Following Barracuda in, which is towing a ship

Challenged on the way to [[New Oxmouth]], [[Captain]] [[Carina Savvy]] of [[The Reaper's Touch]].


told to come to [[Southfort, Coinside]]

Either RP with Harlequin or fight Reaper's Touch.  No fleeing, as it is much too fast (2 higher) special ship.

Main part of navy left with [[Pirate Lords]] [[Jonas Blacktide]], and the flagship, [[The Call of the Void]].  

He's left to the [[2-Sea of Storms]], convinced by the White Witch. Lock and Key and most of Ox forts are bascially gone now, and the lighthouses no longer work.

Coins Navy and whats left of Ox are controlled by [[Quinn 'Harlequin' Harwick]] who was [[Jonas Blacktide]] second in command, but was actually a spy for [[Lord Masque]].
