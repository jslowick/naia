## Scene 1: The Serpents End

Erin or Tony, would you like to spend a Fate Point to have been here sometime recently before the Bounty?

The Southfort on Oxside is dark, and looks empty.

Dockmaster, Dietrich Crowe, fees are exorbitant, why?

Needs list of crew, cargo, more questions than normal

Sabotage, and Edgecoin isnt what it used to be.  Enemies everywhere.

               Portmaster, his mother, Eliza Crowe, will rail on them for asking, when the Coin is the only free island left.

Notable Ships in Port

The Hell Hound, Mad Dog Lucas’s Ship

The Midnight Rose (if not s1)

The Domino

The Albatross

[RYAN ALBATROSS SECRET]

Crew wants to spend the money and go enjoy leave/city

Salt volunteers to stay with the ship, makes Jasper stay too.

Serpents Maw, boats on long dock made of its bones, its jaw covers the door

Bartender Jara Pike

Someone gets thrown through a window as they approach

If they ask about a doc, none here, they get recruited too fast.  Port Abalash has docs, and theres on that doest like sharing treasure equally in Oxmouth, but id stay away from old Goldfingers.

·       Maria Fatale, no nonsense, hates to take prisoners, but hated Victor more

·       Theodoro the Knife, sneaky assassin like pirate

Maria and Theodoro are from here originally, Maria from Coin and Theodoro from Lock

Theodoro is secretly working for Persephone.

Maria is shady and hint to the PCs she’s hiding things.

               In debt to Edgar “Ledger” Hawke because of Victor

               Her mother has been paying the juice while shes been gone.

               Secret meetings:  Loan Shark? Also smugglers she used to work for, info for PCs

               **Contradictory Alibi** She claims she was in one place during a sabotage but a witness swears they saw her elsewhere

               **A Convenient Disappearance** During a raid, fight, or prison break, Maria slips away for a moment.  she was badly wounded and hiding the injury (prideful, didn’t want to seem weak).

Theodoro

               **Shares Suspicion of Maria** Theodoro openly voices suspicion about Maria, reinforcing the red herrings.he’s just throwing her under the bus.

  **Acts of Bravery** He volunteers first for dangerous tasks, maybe even saving a PC in combat — making it hard to imagine he’d betray them.

  **Provides Useful Intel** He "uncovers" sabotage or hidden symbols (that he planted himself), which helps him gain trust as the vigilant crewmate.

One of the side rooms is closed to public, guarded by Amina Okoro “The Undefeated” in the Shipwreck fights and a huge man known as Barricade.

[TONY SECRET]

Maria leaves the Serpents maw after an argument with Pike, looking for her mother.

Theodoro helps PCs find Wilton, expresses worry that Maria is hiding things.

## Scene 2: W&W Imports

W&W Imports

Run by Wilton and Wei Lin Newcomb

Not all is as it seems

                             Working for Persephone, who is working for Calypso, against Lysandra/Callisto

[Bill Secret here]

Knows an expert on caves, Dr. Fenric Pebbleton (Don’t call him pebble tongue, he hates that) that works at the Arcanist Emporium.  Normally don’t like pirates much, but will probably make an exception that he owes Wilton a favor.

Willing to buy all firebeards stuff and hold/promise, or store it but not buy

Would buy rubies for 100 but worth double that in cimmeria

Business partner/wife, Wei Lin, is away in the sea of storms

Apprentice has gone to Oxmouth and hasn’t returned

               Familiar (White Snake) in cage, asks bill to be let out

Wants help delivering cargo to the Commodore’s brother of Oxmouth and the Portmaster of Safe Harbor (though you will have to go not in pirate colors there).  Will pay handsomely, as he is late with shipments but has no help left.

Recruits Theodoro to deliver the Dockmaster, Detrik Crowe to (known Lysandra sympathizer) who ends up dead.  Maria skips out on delivery to deal with the loan shark.

## Scene 3: The Arcanist Emporium

Sciency store, run by people from Deephaven

               Dr. Fenric Pebbleton (recognizes Gianna from Freehold)

HATES being called Pebbletongue

Doesn’t like pirates, even with Wiltons connection

               Challenge to get inside.

Wants to see the gun.  Talks about a famous gunsmith, but hes a little crazy Yidrin ‘Pyro’ Pyrelle, a guest of the lantern on tarsus.  Pity, used to be amazing. If your ever there, look him up, if you have any sway with the lantern.

Erin sees a compass.  “Don’t worry it doesn’t work, its just a replica commision for a museum in freehold

Know about god’s eye, but its on the next island over, “The Ox”

               People in here recently asking same questions, were from Barracuda (Lord Masques)

               Assistant Wren Tamsford, crush on PC, tells them more than the Doc

Deep in the Ravine, Sunblooms?

               Map of Reyka focusing on Reyka’Est with sharing all they did: 5 gold

               Map of the World: 10 gold

               Map of Aramath, focusing on Coin and Ox, 10 gold

               Can do others, but special order

## Scene 4: The Evening Stroll

The Gilded Chain Brothel, a franchise of brothels on the Coin, the Lock and the Ox, escorts travel between them, and are willing to trade secrets.  Maria found info out, but the Night Madame wants out/off of Aramath in return.

Mike notices, amongst a band of pirates stumbling down the street

Nicholas Beaumont aka Nicky Nine-lives

[MIKE SECRET]

Mad Dog Lucas confronts PCs.

First accuses them of killing his brother.

Parlay? Fight?

Settle the score at Midnight on the full moon on the Shipwreck of the Fallen Angel

get out of town or he’ll blow their ship out of the water. 

Good chance of fight here, willing to push it to 3 days at the Shipwreck

[[The Hell Hound]] Crew here


Returning to the Docks/Ship, Dietrich is murdered, and PCs are questioned as he had just sent them a note about their ship being a nuisance because of the storms.  They tell the PCs not to leave port and their ship will be impounded until its cleared up.

PCs realize it was either Theodoro or Maria or both that did it.


## Scene 5 - Crossing the Missing Eighth
Move to S4 if no time




Following Barracuda in, which is towing a ship

Detriech’s death is blamed on the Wayward Bounty, and so he sends Captain Savvy of the Reaper’s Touch after them.

Challenged on the way to [[New Oxmouth]], [[Captain]] [[Carina Savvy]] of [[The Reaper's Touch]].


told to come to [[Southfort, Coinside]]

Either RP with Harlequin or fight Reaper's Touch.  No fleeing, as it is much too fast (2 higher) special ship.

Main part of navy left with [[Council of Lords]] [[Jonas Blacktide]], and the flagship, [[The Call of the Void]].  

He's left to the [[2-Sea of Storms]], convinced by the White Witch. Lock and Key and most of Ox forts are bascially gone now, and the lighthouses no longer work.

Coins Navy and whats left of Ox are controlled by [[Quinn 'Harlequin' Harwick]] who was [[Jonas Blacktide]] second in command, but was actually a spy for [[Lord Masque]].
