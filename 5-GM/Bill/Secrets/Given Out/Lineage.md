You have been a captive of Anastasia Veron, who leads the Nightmarket Flotilla since you were a small child.  You were told you were a prince, and although not as valuable as a princess, you were treated well, but always knew you were a hostage.  You’ve grown up on the Sea of Night, and learned from Anastasia, who you also guess is a Witch herself, though her affinity is with cats, and yours is more with rats.  You stowed away on the Aurora when it came and first time you’ve seen the sun, but were immediately captured by Pirates.  You are sure she is looking for you too.
