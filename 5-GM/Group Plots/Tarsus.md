Owns tarsus, and all 3 “Competing” wineries

Tarsus, 3 breweries in the 3 circles, all “competing” but actually all owned by the same guy

Nightshift brewery, run off a flotilla, harvest the hops only at night, preserves more of the alcohol, “Black Ale” has almost triple the alcohol than normal.

Special Saltwater sugarcane, but it makes the water too sweet the next year

Special Saltwater Grapes, that take the enhanced sweetness but make the water too alcoholic next year

Special Saltwater Hops that take the extra alcohol, but flavor the water too fruity next year

So three breweries rotate, thus causing special batches of X circle etc.
