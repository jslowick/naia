## Scene 1: The Negotiations

Recap, fid being fishy.

Tony Vision retcon – forgot the prodigal son on aramath

Victoria brings the two windspeakers up too early

Penny looks at primrose and pales, she would like to renegotiate.  That monster

Fid smalltalk about Barracuda, Lord Masques ship

Erin – wants to go below decks to search for a compass

Ryan – wants a worm

Wants: Windspeakers, Crew

Gives: Search his ship, Salts Bird, Violin, worm?

Hellstring Dirge

Won it in a game on Aramath, at the Dead Man’s Hand.Said to be won by Joel “Jolly” Roger vs the Devil himself, First Mate to Davy Jones. Was practicing with it before the shark attack.  (This part sounds a little fishy to PCs)  The old captain, Roderic Vance refused to let him play it on the ship after a while.  Theres a bit of a longing to keep it, but greed of keeping the full ransom is in play as well.

The Hellstring Dirge

This item requires practice to attune to. (XP and time)

Once attuned the item is cursed and you may not willingly give it up unless bested in a contest.  You may not turn down contests or challenges.

While the case is open, and Fiddle in hand, the morale of every NPC in the area (good and bad) is lowered.

The bow counts as a bladed weapon in melee combat.

1/scene If the fiddle is in hand when a human dies, this item gains a charge.                 At 20 charges, The fiddle awakens and becomes sentient and is no longer a cursed to you.

1/session, Roll Panache to play the Fiddle, and attempt to influence a person, place or thing, if this is done in combat may take multiple rounds, but can still act while playing (Unreliable)

[-]          The Song has the opposite effect.

              Fate Point: The song has a wildly and maybe permanently opposite effect.

[ ]          The song is somewhat successful, at a cost

[+]         The song is successful.

              Fate Point: The song is wildly and maybe permanently successful.

## Scene 2: Below Decks

Will agree to Tony going below, Neve can sneak as well.  Erin hmm

Primrose is hiding something below decks, that she got for selene

Most of the hold has been rearranged, theres a large glass box in it, swirling in Mist something in it. (Djinn)

Its For Selene

Primrose says its hers, and she didn’t go to the Sea of Mists and then deal with a shipwreck, then fight a witch for nothing.  She warns she will fight if PCs pursue this further.

If tony, he gets bamboozled by primrose, if anyone else, compel vs primrose that she feeds on them, and they forget what they see

If only neve sees

Squeak… squeak… master, master… big box, iron corners, rivets tight. Glass shines, fog inside, swirling, whispering. Claws? No Hands… yes, yes hands press walls, pale, twitchy. Rest hides… mist lost, can’t see, can’t smell. Feels wrong, feels hungry. Squeak-squeak… don’t like it, master. Want to scamper, want to hide in dark cracks, far from the box…

## Scene 3: The Red Darling (1h+)

### Scene 4: The Midnight Rose

A couple hours later, as you are limping towards Aramath, Another ship on the horizon, heading strait towards you at night.

[TONY COMPEL] Drug withdrawal

It’s the Midnight Rose, captain Von Drakk wants to meet

Meeting on his ship, you provide the dinner

Locke remembers Victor talking about him one saying he was easier to deal with when he was impressed.

               Have to impress him with food and drink

If they run, hard rolls to escape.  If they escape, they dnt see who, will be there or pulling in to coin at the same time.

Laughs about if they run, if they talk about being attacked by red, do they have proof?  Someone unaligned that’s word is good?

You must have been mistaken on what ship attacked you.  These things happen.

After failing to catch the Aurora, Victor returned to Mother of Worms unsuccessful, who got on board at Freeport.  They then learned of the OTC chasing The Wayward Bounty towing the Aurora, and went after them, they wisely avoided the storm, which delayed them a while, then mother of worms sought out the Bounty to see if they got what they needed.

The Midnight Rose

               Nikolai von Drakk – Captain

               “Stitch” Calloway – Doctor

               “Barnacle” Briggs – Ren’yu Bo’sun, has a longer hard to pronounce name

Edrik the Blind – Navigator

Marlowe - Cannoneer

Silas “Crowfoot” Kofit -Lookout

Odette “Scurry” Skurlain – Deck Hand

               Brother Tomas -

Just Von Drakk and his valet, Grimes.  Mother of Worms is in the next room, listening in

Ryan Feels presence of powerful witch, Mother of Worms

[RYAN WITCH SECRET]

Winters, offers to take him to be healed

Wants to know about aurora and says you must uphold deals made under the Bounty

Surprise mutiny, he holds Locke accountable for previous deals.  Wants to know what he found.

Asks about Sonya, will give more info back if they talk about her.  They know because Sonya has a small mirror, which the Mother of Worms could see through.

TONY VISION – Witchs can use mirrors

If told aramath, the white witch controls most of it now, be careful, I am no friend of hers either.  I personally stabbed her through the heart once, she didn’t die.  Maybe turn her over to the OTC, their burnings tend to stick.  Maybe not though, who wants to grovel at their feet.

Another competition?  Your predecessor was more fun.

Im off to The Sea of Storms, but when im done there, im going back to Ashander’s Folly to call for council, I expect you to have gone and confessed, I mean registered your mutiny by then.  The threat is implicit.

Interrupted by “Barnacle” who is a ren’yu and comes in soaking wet, about an important matter, leaves just Grimes here (if ryan wants to try to get in to other room)

Grimes knows: Sir Braxton Crowley, Gianna’s dad.  They were both OTC back in the day, both served on the HMS Abigail, captained by the insufferable Braxton Reed.  Your father took his first name as an insult when he defected.

Wants to know about Crowley, hasn’t seen him in some time.

Odette “Scurry” Skurlain saw Rakes rat, and feels a kindred spirit

Shes missing the pinky on her right hand

She wants to be the Spider Queen and seeks the regalia.  Does Rake seek the Rat Kings Regalia as well? 

Us Vermin should stick together.  You can trust Mother, worms rats and spiders, all together strong.

Scurry wants Rake to bring something to Aramath, deliver it to Corvus, the figurehead of the Long Shadow.  Mother promised it’d be there.

               About backpack sized burlap sack, Tied with many, many knots.  Inside, wrapped in cloth, is Worm-eaten book, the book as a rune bonding on it that Rake doesn’t know what happens if its opened.  Ryan might.  Maybe a test by mother of worms.

Pull up to Edgecoin, on Aramaths “The Coin” town looks normal, ships in dock, including the Domino  (Midnight rose if no time for it)

There are MUCH less patrolling ships than there used to be, half the Pirates ships used to be here and they appear to be gone, or not patrolling the south side anymore.
