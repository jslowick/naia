Technically the highest rank in [[2-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Lanshire/Lanshire|Lanshire]], Charlemain lets [[Joseph 'Blackjack' Varchek|Blackjack]] run the [[Ostean Trade Consortium|OTC]] and the Navy, and he handles the day to day governance of the largest of the Island States in Naia.Â  Not much in known about him or the rest of [[House Tiverton]], as he is a very private, almost secretive man.  While he is often at ceremonies and such, he rarely speaks.
