The second eldest [[House Tiverton]] Daughter, the first, [[Sarah Tiverton (Dead)|Sarah]] was killed for being a witch.Â  Sonya sort of abruptly had the spotlight shined on her, and now is rumored to have been betrothed to the [[Aethys Kyrill the Skyborne]] of the [[Windspeakers]].

Sonya is big in volunteering, and often has orphans around, [[Jasper 'The Kid' Ravenhart]] was one of those, and is now her Ward.

It was revealed in [[S1 - To the Animus]] that Sonya actually had fled [[2-People/Ostean Trade Consortium/Lanshire/Lanshire]] on the [[WSS Aurora (Missing)]] and then made a deal with [[Victor 'The Mad' Maddington (Missing)]] and [[Tristan Winters]] when the Aurora was taken.  After the Mutiny, she hid her presence from the new crew of [[The Wayward Bounty]], until she was given up by Jasper.  The 10+ year old [[Portrait of Sonya|portrait]] [[Harlan 'Redpan' Rask]] pulled from [[The Catacombs]] matches her exactly.

Owns a purebread persian cat named [[Buttercup]].
