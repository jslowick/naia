Said to have started as a deck hand, and rose to be [[Lord Masque]]'s personal assassin.  The rumors are he recently gifted her a ship, [[The Marlin]], from a captain he had her kill.  The ship is fairly damaged.  It's unclear if she will just be part of his fleet, or go off on her own.

She wears a black lace half mask in "solidarity" with Lord Masque, and is said to take it off before killing a victim.
