Briggs served under [[Percival Windam (Dead)]] on the [[The Valiant|HMS Valiant]].  They were ordered to bring [[Ren'Yu]] slaves from one prt of [[Lanshire Reef]] to another.  Briggs highly disagreed with slavery, and mutinied.  In the fight for the ship, one of Briggs' side shot Percival in the face.  After Briggs won, and was voted in Captain, he turned pirate.  He tends to stick to [[Flotillas]] and avoid permanent Pirate settlements.

Supposedly Briggs still has a Bounty by the Windams to this day.
