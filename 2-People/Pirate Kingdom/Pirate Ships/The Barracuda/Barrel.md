#person #pirate #barracuda

Large, muscular and fat man covered in tattoos.  He rarely wears a shirt, or long pants, showing them off.  Has a tattoo on the top of his bald head, which is said to be a map to a temple on [[Skull Island]], where he claims to be from, though many dispute that.

Says he enjoys two things in life, fighting and drinking.  Will fight for the hell of it and carries a large club studded with [[Jawfish]] teeth.  Not much of a sailor, but has "other uses" on [[The Barracuda]].
