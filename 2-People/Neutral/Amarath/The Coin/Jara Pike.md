Summary: [[Windspeakers|Ex-windspeaker]] Tavernkeep of The [[Serpent's End]] on [[2-People/Neutral/Amarath/The Coin/The Coin|The Coin]].

Pike was travelling by [[Aramath]] and saw it being attacked by a Wyrm.  He did battle with the [[Wyrms|Wyrm]], and killed it defending [[2-People/Neutral/Amarath/The Coin/The Coin|The Coin]] but his ship was wrecked in the process and his treasure he was supposed to return to the [[Eastern Wind Isles]] was lost in [[The Missing Eighth]].  He opted to join the pirates vs return to the [[Windspeakers]] empty handed.  

With help, he converted the wreckage of his ship into the tavern, [[Serpent's End]].
